Statistics?  Definition - Statistics. Statistics is a branch of Mathematics that deals with data collection, summary, analysis and interpretation.   The role of Statistics is to extract information from data in order to gain knowledge for taking decisions.\nStatistics is essential in any scientific or technical discipline which requires data handling, especially with large volumes of data, such as Physics, Chemistry, Medicine, Psychology, Economics or Social Sciences.\nBut, why is Statistics necessary?\nA changing World Scientists try to study the World. A World with a high variability that makes difficult determining the behaviour of things.\nStatistics provides a bridge between the real world and the mathematical models that attempt to explain it, providing a methodology to assess the discrepancies between reality and theoretical models.\nThis makes Statistics an indispensable tool in applied sciences that require design of experiments and data analysis.\nPopulation and sample Statistical population  Definition - Population. A population is a set of elements defined by an or more features that has all the elements and only them. Every element of the population is called individual.\nDefinition - Population size. The number of individuals in a population is known as the population size and is represented by $N$.\n  Sometimes not all the individuals are accessible to study. Then we distinguish between:\n Theoretical population: Individuals to which we want to extrapolate the study conclusions. Studied population: Individuals truly accessible in the study.  Example. In a study about a particular disease, the theoretical population would be all the persons that suffered the disease in some moment, even if they were not born yet. While the studied population will be the set o persons that have suffered the disease and that we can really study (observe that this exclude people with the disease but that we do not have any mean to get information about them).\nDrawbacks in the population study Scientists study a phenomenon in a population to understand it, to get knowledge about it, and so to control it.\nBut, for a complete knowledge of the population it is necessary to study all its individuals.\nHowever, this is not always possible for several reasons:\n The population size is infinite or too large to study all its individuals. The operations that individuals undergo are destructive. The cost, both in money and time, that would require study all the individuals in the population is not affordable.  Statistics Sample When it is not possible or convenient to study all the individuals in a population, we study only a subset of them.\n Definition - Sample. A sample is a subset of the population.\nDefinition - Sample size. The number of individuals of the sample is called sample size and is represented by $n$.\n  Usually, the population study is conducted on samples drawn from it.\nThe sample study only gives an approximate knowledge of the population. But in most cases it is enough.\nSample size determination One of the most interesting questions that arise:\nHow many individuals are required to sample to have an approximate but enough knowledge of the population?\nThe answer depends of several factors, as the population variability or the desired reliability for extrapolations to the population.\nUnfortunately we can not answer that question until the end of the course, but in general, the most individuals the sample has, the more reliable will the conclusions be on the population, but also the study will be longer and more expensive.\nExample. To understand what a sufficient sample size means we can use a picture example. A digital photography consist of a lot of small points called pixels disposed in an big array layout with rows and columns (the more rows and columns, the more resolution the picture has). Here the picture is the population and every pixel is an individual. Every pixel has a colour and it is the variability of colours what forms the picture motif.\nHow many pixels must we take in a sample in order to know the motif of a picture?\nThe answer depends on the variability of colours in the picture. If all the pixels in the picture are of the same colour, only one pixel is required to know the motif. But, if there is a lot of variability in the colours, a large sample size will be required.\nThe image below contains a small sample of the pixels of a picture. Could you find out the motif of the picture?\nWith a small sample size it is difficult to find out the picture motif!\nSurely you has not been able to guess the motif because the number of pixels picked in the sample is too small to understand the variability of colours in the picture.\nThe image below contains a larger sample of pixels. Could you find out the motif of the picture now?\nWith a large sample is easier to find out the picture motif!\nAnd here is the whole population.\nIt is not required to know all the pixels of a picture to find out its motif!\nTypes of reasoning Deduction properties: If the premises are true, it guarantees the certainty of the conclusions (that is, if something is true in the population, it is also true in the sample). However,\nInduction properties: It does not guarantee the certainty of the conclusions (if something is true in the sample, it may not be true in the population, so be careful with the extrapolations!). But, it is the only way to generate new knowledge!\nStatistics is fundamentally based on inductive reasoning, because it uses the information obtained from samples to draw conclusions about populations.\nSampling  Definition - Sampling. The process of selecting the elements included in a sample is known as sampling.   To reflect reliable information about the whole population, the sample must be representative of the population. That means that the sample should reproduce on a smaller scale the population variability.\nThe goal is to get a representative sample of the population.\nTypes of sampling There exist a lot of sampling methods but all of them can be grouped in two categories:\nRandom sampling: The sample individuals are selected randomly. All the population individuals have the same likelihood of being selected (equiprobability).\nNon random sampling: The sample individuals are not selected randomly. Some population individuals have a higher likelihood of being selected than others.\nOnly random sampling methods avoid the selection bias and guarantee the representativeness of the sample, and therefore, the validity of conclusions.\nNon random sampling methods are not suitable to make generalizations because they do not guarantee the representativeness of the sample. Nevertheless, usually they are less expensive and can be used in exploratory studies.\nSimple random sampling The most popular random sampling method is the simple random sampling, that has the following properties:\n All the population individuals have the same likelihood of being selected in the sample. The individual selection is performed with replacement, that is, each selected individual is returned to the population before selecting the next one. In this way the population does not change. Each individual selection is independent of the others.  The only way of doing a random sampling is to assign a unique identity number to each population individual (conducting a census) and performing a random drawing.\nStatistical variables In every statistical study we are interested in some properties or characteristics of individuals.\n Definition - Statistical variable. A statistical variable is a property or characteristic measured in the population individuals.   The data is the actual values or outcomes recorded on a statistical variable.\nTypes of statistical variables According to the nature of their values and their scale, they can be:\n  Qualitative variables. They measure non-numeric qualities. They can be:\n  Nominals: There is no natural order between its categories. Example: The hair colour or the gender.\n  Ordinals: There is a natural order between its categories. Example: The education level.\n    Quantitative variables: They measure numeric quantities. They can be:\n  Discrete: Their values are isolated numbers (usually integers). Example: The number of children or cars in a family.\n  Continuous: They can take any value in a real interval. Example: The height, weight or age of a person.\n    Qualitative and discrete variables are also called categorical variables and their values categories.\nChoosing the appropriate type of variable Sometimes a characteristic could be measured in variables of different types.\nExample. Whether a person smokes or not could be measure in several ways:\n  Smokes: yes/no. (Nominal)\n  Smoking level: No smoking/unusual/moderate/quite/heavy. (Ordinal)\n  Number of cigarettes per day: 0,1,2,\u0026hellip;(Discrete)\n  In those cases quantitative variables are preferable to qualitative, continuous variables are preferable to discrete variables and ordinal variables are preferable to nominal, as they give more information.\nAccording to their role in the study:\n  Independent variables: Variables that do not depend on other variables in the study. Usually they are manipulate in an experiment in order to observe their effect on a dependent variable. They are also known as predictor variables.\n  Dependent variables: Variables that depend on other variables in the study. They are not manipulated in an experiment and are also known as outcome variables.\n  Example. In a study on the performance of students in a course, the intelligence of students and the daily study time are independent variables, while the course grade is a dependent variable.\nTypes of statistical studies According to their role in the study:\n  Experimental: When the independent variables are manipulated in order to see the effect that that change has on the dependent variables.\nExample. In a study on the performance of students in a test, the teacher manipulates the methodology and creates two or more groups following different methodologies.\n  Non-experimental: When the independent variables are not manipulated. That does not mean that it is impossible to do so, but it will either be impractical or unethical to do so.\nExample. In a study a researcher could be interested in the effect of smoking over the lung cancer. However, whilst possible, it would be unethical to ask individuals to smoke in order to study what effect this had on their lungs. In this case, the researcher could study two groups of people, one with lung cancer and other without, an observe in each group how many persons smoke or not.\n  Experimental studies allow to identify a cause and effect between variables while non-experimental studies only allow to identify association or relationship between variables.\nThe data table The variables of a study will be measured in each individual of the sample. This will give a data set that usually is arranged in a tabular form known as data table.\nIn this table each column contains the information of a variable and each row contains the information of an individual.\nExample. The table below contains data about the variables Name, Age, Gender, Weight and Height of a sample of 6 persons.\n   Name Age Gender Weight(Kg) Height(cm)     JosÃ© Luis MartÃ­nez 18 H 85 179   Rosa DÃ­az 32 M 65 173   Javier GarcÃ­a 24 H 71 181   Carmen LÃ³pez 35 M 65 170   Marisa LÃ³pez 46 M 51 158   Antonio Ruiz 68 H 66 174    Phases of a statistical study Usually a statistical study goes through the following phases:\n  The study begins with a previous design in which the study goals, the population, the variables to measure and the required sample size are set.\n  Next, the sample is selected from the population and the variables are measured in the individuals of the sample (getting the data table). This is accomplished by Sampling.\n  The next step consists in describing and summarizing the information of the sample. This is the job of Descriptive Statistics.\n  Then, the information obtained is projected on a mathematical model that intend to explain what happens in population, and the model is validated. This is accomplished by Inferential Statistics.\n  Finally, the validated model is used to perform predictions and to draw conclusions on the population.\n  The statistical cycle ","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1600206500,"objectID":"25b11930afc1ea0d302f6d13ef3201a2","permalink":"/en/teaching/statistics/manual/introduction/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/en/teaching/statistics/manual/introduction/","section":"teaching","summary":" ","tags":["Statistics"],"title":"Introduction","type":"book"},{"authors":null,"categories":["Statistics","Biostatistics"],"content":"Descriptive Statistics is the part of Statistics in charge of representing, analysing and summarizing the information contained in the sample.\nAfter the sampling process, this is the next step in every statistical study and usually consists of:\n  To classify, group and sort the data of the sample.\n  To tabulate and plot data according to their frequencies.\n  To calculate numerical measures that summarize the information contained in the sample (sample statistics).\n  It has no inferential power, so do not generalize to the population from the measures computed by Descriptive Statistics!.\nFrequency distribution The study of a statistical variable starts by measuring the variable in the individuals of the sample and classifying the values.\nThere are two ways of classifying data:\n  Non-grouping: Sorting values from lowest to highest value (if there is an order). Used with qualitative variables and discrete variables with few distinct values.\n  Grouping: Grouping values into intervals (classes) and sort them from lowest to highest intervals. Used with continuous variables and discrete variables with many distinct values.\n  Sample classification It consists in grouping the values that are the same and sorting them if there is an order among them.\nExample. $X=$Height\nFrequency count It consists in counting the number of times that every value appears in the sample.\nExample. $X=$Height\nSample frequencies  Definition - Sample frequencies. Given a sample of $n$ values of a variable $X$, for every value $x_i$ of the variable we define\n  Absolute Frequency $n_i$: The number of times that value $x_i$ appears in the sample.\n  Relative Frequency $f_i$: The proportion of times that value $x_i$ appears in the sample.\n  $$f_i = \\frac{n_i}{n}$$\n Cumulative Absolute Frequency $N_i$: The number of values in the sample less than or equal to $x_i$.  $$N_i = n_1 + \\cdots + n_i = N_{i-1}+n_i$$\n Cumulative Relative Frequency $F_i$: The proportion of values in the sample less than or equal to $x_i$.  $$F_i = \\frac{N_i}{n}$$\n  Frequency table The set of values of a variable with their respective frequencies is called frequency distribution of the variable in the sample, and it is usually represented as a frequency table.\n   $X$ values Absolute frequency Relative frequency Cumulative absolute frequency Cumulative relative frequency     $x_1$ $n_1$ $f_1$ $N_1$ $F_1$   $\\vdots$ $\\vdots$ $\\vdots$ $\\vdots$ $\\vdots$   $x_i$ $n_i$ $f_i$ $N_i$ $F_i$   $\\vdots$ $\\vdots$ $\\vdots$ $\\vdots$ $\\vdots$   $x_k$ $n_k$ $f_k$ $N_k$ $F_k$    Example - Quantitative variable and non-grouped data.

A usual rule of thumb is to take a number of intervals approximately $\\sqrt{n}$ or $\\log_2(n)$. The intervals must not overlap and must cover the entire range of values. It does not matter if intervals are left-open and right-closed or vice versa. The minimum value must fall in the first interval and the maximum value in the last.  Example - Qualitative variable. The blood types of 30 people are:\nA, B, B, A, AB, 0, 0, A, B, B, A, A, A, A, AB, A, A, A, B, 0, B, B, B, A, A, A, 0, A, AB, 0.

Depending on the type of variable and whether data has been grouped or not, there are different types of charts:\n  Bar chart\n  Histogram\n  Line or polygon chart.\n  Pie chart\n  Bar chart A bar chart consists of a set of bars, one for every value or category of the variable, plotted on a coordinate system.\nUsually the values or categories of the variable are represented on the $x$-axis, and the frequencies on the $y$-axis. For each value or category of the variable, a bar is draw to the height of its frequency. The width of the bar is not important but bars should be clearly separated among them.\nDepending on the type of frequency represented in the $y$-axis we get different types of bar charts.\nSometimes a polygon, known as frequency polygon, is plotted joining the top of every bar with straight lines.\nExample. The bar chart below shows the absolute frequency distribution of the number of children in the previous sample.\n  (function() { let a = setInterval( function() { if ( typeof window.Plotly === 'undefined' ) { return; } clearInterval( a ); Plotly.d3.json(\"./img/absolute-barchart.json\", function(chart) { Plotly.plot('chart-954368217', chart.data, chart.layout, {responsive: true}); }); }, 500 ); })();  The bar chart below shows the relative frequency distribution of the number of children with the frequency polygon.\n {\"x\":{\"data\":[{\"type\":\"bar\",\"inherit\":true,\"x\":[0,1,2,3,4],\"y\":[0.08,0.24,0.56,0.08,0.04],\"name\":\"bar\", \"marker\":{\"color\":\"rgba(137,211,243,1)\"}},{\"type\":\"scatter\",\"inherit\":true,\"x\":[0,1,2,3,4],\"y\":[0.08,0.24,0.56,0.08,0.04],\"name\":\"polygon\", \"marker\":{\"color\":\"rgba(238,50,36,1)\"}}],\"layout\":{\"title\":\"Relative frequency distribution of number of children\",\"xaxis\":{\"title\":\"Number of children\"},\"yaxis\":{\"title\":\"Relative frequency\"},\"autosize\":false,\"width\":600,\"height\":400,\"bargap\":0.5,\"showlegend\":false,\"margin\":{\"b\":40,\"l\":60,\"t\":25,\"r\":10}},\"filename\":\"Relative frequency distribution of number of children\"},\"evals\":[]} The bar chart below shows the cumulative absolute frequency distribution of the number of children.\n {\"x\":{\"data\":[{\"type\":\"bar\",\"inherit\":true,\"x\":[0,1,2,3,4],\"y\":[2,8,22,24,25], \"marker\":{\"color\":\"rgba(137,211,243,1)\"}}],\"layout\":{\"title\":\"Cumulative absolute frequency distribution of number of children\",\"xaxis\":{\"title\":\"Number of children\"},\"yaxis\":{\"title\":\"Cumulative absolute frequency\"},\"autosize\":false, \"width\":600, \"height\":400,\"barsgap\":0.5,\"bargap\":0.5,\"margin\":{\"b\":40,\"l\":60,\"t\":25,\"r\":10}},\"filename\":\"Cumulative absolute frequency distribution of number of children\"},\"evals\":[]}  And the bar chart below shows the cumulative relative frequency distribution of the number of children with the frequency polygon.\n {\"x\":{\"data\":[{\"type\":\"bar\",\"inherit\":true,\"x\":[0,0,1,2,3,4],\"y\":[0,0.08,0.32,0.88,0.96,1],\"name\":\"bar\", \"marker\":{\"color\":\"rgba(137,211,243,1)\"}},{\"type\":\"scatter\",\"inherit\":true,\"x\":[0,0,1,2,3,4],\"y\":[0,0.08,0.32,0.88,0.96,1],\"name\":\"polygon\",\"line\":{\"shape\":\"hv\"}, \"marker\":{\"color\":\"rgba(238,50,36,1)\"}}],\"layout\":{\"title\":\"Cumulative relative frequency distribution of number of children\",\"xaxis\":{\"title\":\"Number of children\"},\"yaxis\":{\"title\":\"Cumulative relative frequency\"},\"autosize\":false,\"width\":600,\"height\":400,\"bargap\":0.5,\"showlegend\":false,\"margin\":{\"b\":40,\"l\":60,\"t\":25,\"r\":10}}, \"filename\":\"Cumulative relative frequency distribution of number of children\"},\"evals\":[]}  Histogram A histogram is similar to a bar chart but for grouped data.\nUsually the classes or grouping intervals are represented on the $x$-axis, and the frequencies on the $y$-axis. For each class, a bar is draw to the height of its frequency. Contrary to bar charts, the width of bars coincides with the width of classes, and there are no space between two consecutive bars.\nDepending on the type of frequency represented in the $y$-axis we get different types of histograms.\nAs with the bar chart, the frequency polygon can be drawn joining the top centre of every bar with straight lines.\nExample. The histogram below shows the absolute frequency distribution of heights.\n {\"x\":{\"data\":[{\"type\":\"histogram\",\"inherit\":true,\"x\":[179,173,181,169,158,174,172,166,194,185,162,187,198,177,178,165,154,188,166,171,175,182,167,169,172,186,172,176,168,187],\"marker\":{\"line\":{\"width\":1},\"color\":\"rgba(137,211,243,1)\"}}],\"layout\":{\"title\":\"Absolute frequency distribution of heights\",\"xaxis\":{\"title\":\"Height\"},\"yaxis\":{\"title\":\"Absolute frequency\"},\"autosize\":false,\"width\":600,\"height\":400,\"margin\":{\"b\":40,\"l\":60,\"t\":25,\"r\":10}},\"url\":null,\"width\":null,\"height\":null,\"base_url\":\"https://plot.ly\",\"layout.1\":{\"title\":\"Absolute frequency distribution of heights\",\"xaxis\":{\"title\":\"Height\"},\"yaxis\":{\"title\":\"Absolute frequency\"},\"autosize\":false,\"width\":600,\"height\":400},\"filename\":\"Absolute frequency distribution of heights\"},\"evals\":[]} The histogram below shows the relative frequency distribution of heights with the frequency polygon.\n {\"x\":{\"data\":[{\"type\":\"histogram\",\"inherit\":true,\"x\":[179,173,181,169,158,174,172,166,194,185,162,187,198,177,178,165,154,188,166,171,175,182,167,169,172,186,172,176,168,187],\"marker\":{\"line\":{\"width\":1},\"color\":\"rgba(137,211,243,1)\"},\"histnorm\":\"probability\",\"name\":\"bar\"},{\"type\":\"scatter\",\"inherit\":true,\"x\":[155,165,175,185,195],\"marker\":{\"line\":{\"width\":1},\"color\":\"rgba(238,50,36,1)\"},\"histnorm\":\"probability\",\"name\":\"polygon\",\"y\":[0.0667,0.2667,0.3667,0.2333,0.0667]}],\"layout\":{\"title\":\"Relative frequency distribution of heights\",\"xaxis\":{\"title\":\"Height\"},\"yaxis\":{\"title\":\"Relative frequency\"},\"autosize\":false,\"width\":600,\"height\":400,\"showlegend\":false,\"margin\":{\"b\":40,\"l\":60,\"t\":25,\"r\":10}},\"url\":null,\"width\":null,\"height\":null,\"base_url\":\"https://plot.ly\",\"layout.1\":{\"title\":\"Relative frequency distribution of heights\",\"xaxis\":{\"title\":\"Height\"},\"yaxis\":{\"title\":\"Relative frequency\"},\"autosize\":false,\"width\":600,\"height\":400,\"showlegend\":false},\"filename\":\"Relative frequency distribution of heights\"},\"evals\":[]} The cumulative frequency polygon (for absolute or relative frequencies) is known as ogive.\nExample.

Each slice is called a sector and its angle or area is proportional to the frequency of the corresponding value or category.\nPie charts can represent absolute or relative frequencies, but not cumulative frequencies, and are used with nominal qualitative variables. For ordinal qualitative or quantitative variables is better to use bar charts, because it is easier to perceive differences in one dimension (length of bars) than in two dimensions (areas of sectors).\nExample. The pie chart below shows the relative frequency distribution of blood types.\n {\"x\":{\"data\":[{\"type\":\"pie\",\"inherit\":true,\"labels\":[\"0\",\"A\",\"AB\",\"B\"],\"values\":[5,14,3,8]}],\"layout\":{\"title\":\"Relative frequency distribution of blood types\",\"autosize\":false,\"width\":600,\"height\":400,\"margin\":{\"b\":40,\"l\":60,\"t\":25,\"r\":10}},\"url\":null,\"width\":null,\"height\":null,\"base_url\":\"https://plot.ly\",\"layout.1\":{\"title\":\"Relative frequency distribution of blood types\",\"autosize\":false,\"width\":600,\"height\":400},\"filename\":\"Relative frequency distribution of blood types\"},\"evals\":[]} The normal distribution Distributions with different properties will show different shapes.\nOutliers One of the main problems in samples are outliers, values very different from the rest of values of the sample.\nExample. The last height of the following sample of heights is an outlier.\nIt is important to find out outliers before doing any analysis, because outliers usually distort the results.\nThey always appears in the ends of the distribution, and can be found out easily with a box and whiskers chart (as be show later).\nOutliers management With big samples outliers have less importance and can be left in the sample.\nWith small samples we have several options:\n Remove the outlier if it is an error. Replace the outlier by the lower or higher value in the distribution that is not an outlier if it is not an error and the outlier does not fit the theoretical distribution. Leave the outlier if it is not an error, and change the theoretical model to fit it to outliers.  Sample statistics The frequency table and charts summarize and give an overview of the distribution of values of the studied variable in the sample, but it is difficult to describe some aspects of the distribution from it, as for example, which are the most representative values of the distribution, how is the spread of data, which data could be considered outliers, or how is the symmetry of the distribution.\nTo describe those aspects of the sample distribution more specific numerical measures, called sample statistics, are used.\nAccording to the aspect of the distribution that they study, there are different types of statistics:\nMeasures of locations: They measure the values where data are concentrated or that divide the distribution into equal parts.\nMeasures of dispersion: They measure the spread of data.\nMeasures of shape: They measure aspects related to the shape of the distribution , as the symmetry and the concentration of data around the mean.\nLocation statistics There are two groups:\nCentral location measures: They measure the values where data are concentrated, usually at the centre of the distribution. These values are the values that best represents the sample data. The most important are:\n Arithmetic mean Median Mode  Non-central location measures: They divide the sample data into equals parts. The most important are:\n Quartiles. Deciles. Percentiles.  Arithmetic mean  Definition - Sample arithmetic mean $\\bar{x}$. The sample arithmetic mean of a variable $X$ is the sum of observed values in the sample divided by the sample size\n$$\\bar{x} = \\frac{\\sum x_i}{n}$$\n  It can be calculated from the frequency table with the formula\n$$\\bar{x} = \\frac{\\sum x_in_i}{n} = \\sum x_i f_i$$\nIn most cases the arithmetic mean is the value that best represent the observed values in the sample.\nWatch out! It can not be calculated with qualitative variables.\nExample - Non-grouped data. Using the data of the sample with the number of children of families, the arithmetic mean is\n$$ \\begin{aligned} \\bar{x} \u0026amp;= \\frac{1+2+4+2+2+2+3+2+1+1+0+2+2}{25}+\\newline\\newline \u0026amp;+\\frac{0+2+2+1+2+2+3+1+2+2+1+2}{25} = \\frac{44}{25} = 1.76 \\mbox{ children}. \\end{aligned} $$\nor using the frequency table\n$$ \\begin{array}{rrrrr} \\hline x_i \u0026amp; n_i \u0026amp; f_i \u0026amp; x_in_i \u0026amp; x_if_i\\newline \\hline 0 \u0026amp; 2 \u0026amp; 0.08 \u0026amp; 0 \u0026amp; 0\\newline 1 \u0026amp; 6 \u0026amp; 0.24 \u0026amp; 6 \u0026amp; 0.24\\newline 2 \u0026amp; 14 \u0026amp; 0.56 \u0026amp; 28 \u0026amp; 1.12\\newline 3 \u0026amp; 2 \u0026amp; 0.08 \u0026amp; 6 \u0026amp; 0.24\\newline 4 \u0026amp; 1 \u0026amp; 0.04 \u0026amp; 4 \u0026amp; 0.16 \\newline \\hline \\sum \u0026amp; 25 \u0026amp; 1 \u0026amp; 44 \u0026amp; 1.76 \\newline \\hline \\end{array} $$\n$$ \\bar{x} = \\frac{\\sum x_in_i}{n} = \\frac{44}{25}= 1.76 \\mbox{ children}\\qquad \\bar{x}=\\sum{x_if_i} = 1.76 \\mbox{ children}. $$\nThat means that the value that best represent the number of children in the families of the sample is 1.76 children.\nExample - Grouped data. Using the data of the sample of student heights, the arithmetic mean is\n$$\\bar{x} = \\frac{179+173+\\cdots+187}{30} = 175.07 \\mbox{ cm}.$$\nor using the frequency table and taking the class marks as $x_i$,\n$$ \\begin{array}{crrrrr} \\hline X \u0026amp; x_i \u0026amp; n_i \u0026amp; f_i \u0026amp; x_in_i \u0026amp; x_if_i\\newline \\hline (150,160] \u0026amp; 155 \u0026amp; 2 \u0026amp; 0.07 \u0026amp; 310 \u0026amp; 10.33\\newline (160,170] \u0026amp; 165 \u0026amp; 8 \u0026amp; 0.27 \u0026amp; 1320 \u0026amp; 44.00\\newline (170,180] \u0026amp; 175 \u0026amp; 11 \u0026amp; 0.36 \u0026amp; 1925 \u0026amp; 64.17\\newline (180,190] \u0026amp; 185 \u0026amp; 7 \u0026amp; 0.23 \u0026amp; 1295 \u0026amp; 43.17\\newline (190,200] \u0026amp; 195 \u0026amp; 2 \u0026amp; 0.07 \u0026amp; 390 \u0026amp; 13 \\newline \\hline \\sum \u0026amp; \u0026amp; 30 \u0026amp; 1 \u0026amp; 5240 \u0026amp; 174.67 \\newline \\hline \\end{array} $$\n$$ \\bar{x} = \\frac{\\sum x_in_i}{n} = \\frac{5240}{30}= 174.67 \\mbox{ cm} \\qquad \\bar{x}=\\sum{x_if_i} = 174.67 \\mbox{ cm}. $$\nObserve that when the mean is calculated from the table the result differs a little from the real value, because the values used in the calculations are the class marks instead of the actual values.\nWeighted mean In some cases the values of the sample have different importance. In that case the importance or weight of each value of the sample must be taken into account when calculating the mean.\n Definition - Sample weighted mean $\\bar{x}_p$. Given a sample of values $x_1,\\ldots,x_n$ where every value $x_i$ has a weight $w_i$, the sample weighted mean of variable $X$ is the sum of the product of each value by its weight, divided by sum of weights\n$$\\bar{x}_w = \\frac{\\sum x_iw_i}{\\sum w_i}$$\n  From the frequency table can be calculated with the formula\n$$\\bar{x}_w = \\frac{\\sum x_iw_in_i}{\\sum w_i}$$\nExample. Assume that a student wants to calculate a representative measure of his/her performance in a course. The grade and the credits of every subjects are\n   Subject Credits Grade     Maths 6 5   Economics 4 3   Chemistry 8 6    The arithmetic mean is\n$$\\bar{x} = \\frac{\\sum x_i}{n} = \\frac{5+3+6}{3}= 4.67 \\text{ points}.$$\nHowever, this measure does not represent well the performance of the student, as not all the subjects have the same importance and require the same effort to pass. Subjects with more credits require more work and must have more weight in the calculation of the mean.\nIn this case it is better to use the weighted mean, using the credits as the weights of grades, as a representative measure of the student effort\n$$ \\bar{x}_w = \\frac{\\sum x_iw_i}{\\sum w_i} = \\frac{5\\cdot 6+3\\cdot 4+6\\cdot 8}{6+4+8}= \\frac{90}{18} = 5 \\text{ points}. $$\nMedian  Definition - Sample median $Me$. The sample median of a variable $X$ is the value that is in the middle of the ordered sample.   The median divides the sample distribution into two equal parts, that is, there are the same number of values above and below the median. Therefore, it has cumulative frequencies $N_{Me}= n/2$ y $F_{Me}= 0.5$.\nWatch out! It can not be calculated for nominal variables.\nWith non-grouped data, there are two possibilities:\n Odd sample size: The median is the value in the position $\\frac{n+1}{2}$. Even sample size: The median is the average of values in positions $\\frac{n}{2}$ and $\\frac{n}{2}+1$.  Example. Using the data of the sample with the number of children of families, the sample size is 25, that is odd, and the median is the value in the position $\\frac{25+1}{2} = 13$ of the sorted sample.\n$$0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,2,2,2,2,\\fbox{2},2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,3,4$$\nAnd the median is 2 children.\nWith the frequency table, the median is the lowest value with a cumulative absolute frequency greater than or equal to $13$, or with a cumulative relative frequency greater than or equal to $0.5$.\n$$ \\begin{array}{rrrrr} \\hline x_i \u0026amp; n_i \u0026amp; f_i \u0026amp; N_i \u0026amp; F_i\\newline \\hline 0 \u0026amp; 2 \u0026amp; 0.08 \u0026amp; 2 \u0026amp; 0.08\\newline 1 \u0026amp; 6 \u0026amp; 0.24 \u0026amp; 8 \u0026amp; 0.32\\newline \\color{red}2 \u0026amp; 14 \u0026amp; 0.56 \u0026amp; 22 \u0026amp; 0.88\\newline 3 \u0026amp; 2 \u0026amp; 0.08 \u0026amp; 24 \u0026amp; 0.96\\newline 4 \u0026amp; 1 \u0026amp; 0.04 \u0026amp; 25 \u0026amp; 1 \\newline \\hline \\sum \u0026amp; 25 \u0026amp; 1 \\newline \\hline \\end{array} $$\nMedian calculation for grouped-data For grouped data the median is calculated from the ogive, interpolating in the class with cumulative relative frequency 0.5.\nBoth expressions are equal as the angle $\\alpha$ is the same, and solving the equation we get that the formula for the median is\n$$ Me=l_i+\\frac{0.5-F_{i-1}}{F_i-F_{i-1}}(l_i-l_{i-1})=l_i+\\frac{0.5-F_{i-1}}{f_i}a_i $$\nExample - Grouped data. Using the data of the sample of student heights, the median falls in class (170,180].\nAnd interpolating in interval (170,180] we get\nEquating both expressions and solving the equation, we get\n$$ Me= 170+\\frac{0.5-0.34}{0.7-0.34}(180-170)=170+\\frac{0.16}{0.36}10=174.54 \\mbox{ cm}. $$\nThis means that half of the students in the sample have an height lower than or equal to 174.54 cm and the other half greater than or equal to.\nMode  Definition - Sample Mode $Mo$. The sample mode of a variable $X$ is the most frequent value in the sample.   With grouped data the modal class is the class with the highest frequency.\nIt can be calculated for all types of variables (qualitative and quantitative).\nDistributions can have more than one mode.\nExample. Using the data of the sample with the number of children of families, the value with the highest frequency is $2$, that is the mode $Mo = 2$ children.\n$$ \\begin{array}{rr} \\hline x_i \u0026amp; n_i \\newline \\hline 0 \u0026amp; 2 \\newline 1 \u0026amp; 6 \\newline \\color{red} 2 \u0026amp; 14 \\newline 3 \u0026amp; 2 \\newline 4 \u0026amp; 1 \\newline \\hline \\end{array} $$\nUsing the data of the sample of student heights, the class with the highest frequency is $(170,180]$ that is the modal class $Mo=(170,180]$.\n$$ \\begin{array}{cr} \\hline X \u0026amp; n_i \\newline \\hline (150,160] \u0026amp; 2 \\newline (160,170] \u0026amp; 8 \\newline \\color{red}{(170,180]} \u0026amp; 11 \\newline (180,190] \u0026amp; 7 \\newline (190,200] \u0026amp; 2 \\newline \\hline \\end{array} $$\nWhich central tendency statistic should I use? In general, when all the central tendency statistics can be calculated, is advisable to use them as representative values in the following order:\n  The mean. Mean takes more information from the sample than the others, as it takes into account the magnitude of data.\n  The median. Median takes less information than mean but more than mode, as it takes into account the order of data.\n  The mode. Mode is the measure that fewer information takes from the sample, as it only takes into account the absolute frequency of values.\n  But, be careful with outliers, as the mean can be distorted by them. In that case it is better to use the median as the value most representative.\nExample. If a sample of number of children of 7 families is\n0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 2, 15,  then, $\\bar{x}=3$ children and $Me=1$ children.\nWhich measure represent better the number of children in the sample?\nNon-central location measures The non-central location measures or quantiles divide the sample distribution in equal parts.\nThe most used are:\nQuartiles: Divide the distribution into 4 equal parts. There are 3 quartiles: $C_1$ (25% accumulated) , $C_2$ (50% accumulated), $C_3$ (75% accumulated).\nDeciles: Divide the distribution into 10 equal parts. There are 9 deciles: $D_1$ (10% accumulated) ,â¦, $D_9$ (90% accumulated).\nPercentiles: Divide the distribution into en 100 equal parts. There are 99 percentiles: $P_1$ (1% accumulated),â¦, $P_{99}$ (99% accumulated).\nObserve that there is a correspondence between quartiles, deciles and percentiles. For example, first quartile coincides with percentile 25, and fourth decile coincides with the percentile 40.\nQuantiles are calculated in a similar way to the median. The only difference lies in the cumulative relative frequency that correspond to every quantile.\nExample. Using the data of the sample with the number of children of families, the cumulative relative frequencies were\n$$ \\begin{array}{rr} \\hline x_i \u0026amp; F_i \\newline \\hline 0 \u0026amp; 0.08\\newline 1 \u0026amp; 0.32\\newline 2 \u0026amp; 0.88\\newline 3 \u0026amp; 0.96\\newline 4 \u0026amp; 1\\newline \\hline \\end{array} $$\n$$ \\begin{aligned} F_{Q_1}=0.25 \u0026amp;\\Rightarrow Q_1 = 1 \\text{ children},\\newline F_{Q_2}=0.5 \u0026amp;\\Rightarrow Q_2 = 2 \\text{ children},\\newline F_{Q_3}=0.75 \u0026amp;\\Rightarrow Q_3 = 2 \\text{ children},\\newline F_{D_4}=0.4 \u0026amp;\\Rightarrow D_4 = 2 \\text{ children},\\newline F_{P_{92}}=0.92 \u0026amp;\\Rightarrow P_{92} = 3 \\text{ children}. \\end{aligned}$$\nDispersion statistics Dispersion or spread refers to the variability of data. So, dispersion statistics measure how the data values are scattered in general, or with respect to a central location measure.\nFor quantitative variables, the most important are:\n Range Interquartile range Variance Standard deviation Coefficient of variation  Range  Definition - Sample range. The sample range of a variable $X$ is the difference between the the maximum and the minimum values in the sample.\n$$\\text{Range} = \\max_{x_i} -\\min_{x_i}$$\n  The range measures the largest variation among the sample data. However, it is very sensitive to outliers, as they appear at the ends of the distribution, and for that reason is rarely used.\nInterquartile range The following measure avoids the problem of outliers and is much more used.\n Definition - Sample interquartile range. The sample interquartile range of a variable $X$ is the difference between the third and the first sample quartiles.\n$$\\text{IQR} = Q_3-Q_1$$\n  The interquartile range measures the spread of the 50% central data.\nBox plot The dispersion of a variable in a sample can be graphically represented with a box plot, that represent five descriptive statistics (minimum, quartiles and maximum) known as the five-numbers. It consist in a box, drawn from the lower to the upper quartile, that represent the interquartile range, and two segments, known as the lower and the upper whiskers. Usually the box is split in two with the median.\nThis chart is very helpful as it serves to many purposes:\n It serves to measure the spread of data as it represents the range and the interquartile range. It serves to detect outliers, that are the values outside the interval defined by the whiskers. It serves to measure the symmetry of distribution, comparing the length of the boxes and whiskers above and below the median.  Example. The chart below shows a box plot of newborn weights.\nTo create a box plot follow the steps below:\n  Calculate the quartiles.\n  Draw a box from the lower to the upper quartile.\n  Split the box with the median or second quartile.\n  For the whiskers calculate first two values called fences $f_1$ y $f_2$. The lower fence is the lower quartile minus one and a half the interquartile range, and the upper fence is the upper quartile plus one and a half the interquartile range:\n$$\\begin{aligned} f_1\u0026amp;=Q_1-1.5,\\text{IQR}\\newline f_2\u0026amp;=Q_3+1.5,\\text{IQR} \\end{aligned}$$\nThe fences define the interval where data are considered normal. Any value outside that interval is considered an outlier.\nFor the lower whisker draw a segment from the lower quartile to the lower value in the sample grater than or equal to $f_1$, and for the upper whisker draw a segment from the upper quartile to the highest value in the sample lower than or equal to $f_2$.\n   The whiskers are not the fences.   Finally, if there are outliers, draw a dot at every outlier.  Example. The box plot for the sample with the number of children si shown below.\nDeviations from the mean Another way of measuring spread of data is with respect to a central tendency measure, as for example the mean.\nIn that case, it is measured the distance from every value in the sample to the mean, that is called deviation from the meanÂ·\nIf deviations are big, the mean is less representative than when they are small.\nExample. The grades of 3 students in a course with subjects $A$, $B$ and $C$ are shown below.\n$$ \\begin{array}{cccc} \\hline A \u0026amp; B \u0026amp; C \u0026amp; \\bar x\\newline 0 \u0026amp; 5 \u0026amp; 10 \u0026amp; 5\\newline 4 \u0026amp; 5 \u0026amp; 6 \u0026amp; 5\\newline 5 \u0026amp; 5 \u0026amp; 5 \u0026amp; 5\\newline \\hline \\end{array} $$\nAll the students have the same mean, but, in which case does the mean represent better the course performance?\nVariance and standard deviation  Definition \u0026ndash; Sample variance $s^2$. The sample variance of a variable $X$ is the average of the squared deviations from the mean.\n$$s^2 = \\frac{\\sum (x_i-\\bar x)^2n_i}{n} = \\sum (x_i-\\bar x)^2f_i$$\n  It can also be calculated with the formula\n$$s^2 = \\frac{\\sum x_i^2n_i}{n} -\\bar x^2= \\sum (x_i^2f_i)-\\bar x^2$$\nThe variance has the units of the variable squared, and to ease its interpretation it is common to calculate its square root.\n Definition - Sample standard deviation $s$. The sample standard deviation of a variable $X$ is the square root of the variance.\n$$s = +\\sqrt{s^2}$$\n   Both variance and standard deviation measure the spread of data around the mean. When the variance or the standard deviation are small, the sample data are concentrated around the mean, and the mean is a good representative measure. In contrast, when variance or the standard deviation are high, the sample data are far from the mean, and the mean does not represent so well.\n          Standard deviation small $\\Rightarrow$ Mean is representative   Standard deviation big $\\Rightarrow$ Mean is unrepresentative      Example. The following samples contains the grades of 2 students in 2 subjects\nWhich mean is more representative?\nExample - Non-grouped data. Using the data of the sample with the number of children of families, with mean $\\bar x= 1.76$ children, and adding a new column to the frequency table with the squared values,\n$$ \\begin{array}{rrr} \\hline x_i \u0026amp; n_i \u0026amp; x_i^2n_i \\newline \\hline 0 \u0026amp; 2 \u0026amp; 0 \\newline 1 \u0026amp; 6 \u0026amp; 6 \\newline 2 \u0026amp; 14 \u0026amp; 56\\newline 3 \u0026amp; 2 \u0026amp; 18\\newline 4 \u0026amp; 1 \u0026amp; 16 \\newline \\hline \\sum \u0026amp; 25 \u0026amp; 96 \\newline \\hline \\end{array}$$\n$$s^2 = \\frac{\\sum x_i^2n_i}{n}-\\bar x^2 = \\frac{96}{25}-1.76^2= 0.7424 \\mbox{ children}^2.$$\nand the standard deviation is $s=\\sqrt{0.7424} = 0.8616$ children.\nCompared to the range, that is 4 children, the standard deviation is not very large, so we can conclude that the dispersion of the distribution is small and consequently the mean, $\\bar x=1.76$ children, represents quite well the number of children of families of the sample.\nExample - Grouped data. Using the data of the sample with the heights of students and grouping heights in classes, we got a mean $\\bar x=174.67$ cm. The calculation of variance is the same than for non-grouped data but using the class marks.\n$$ \\begin{array}{crrr} \\hline X \u0026amp; x_i \u0026amp; n_i \u0026amp; x_i^2n_i \\newline \\hline (150,160] \u0026amp; 155 \u0026amp; 2 \u0026amp; 48050\\newline (160,170] \u0026amp; 165 \u0026amp; 8 \u0026amp; 217800\\newline (170,180] \u0026amp; 175 \u0026amp; 11 \u0026amp; 336875\\newline (180,190] \u0026amp; 185 \u0026amp; 7 \u0026amp; 239575\\newline (190,200] \u0026amp; 195 \u0026amp; 2 \u0026amp; 76050\\newline \\hline \\sum \u0026amp; \u0026amp; 30 \u0026amp; 918350 \\newline \\hline \\end{array} $$\n$$s^2 = \\frac{\\sum x_i^2n_i}{n}-\\bar x^2 = \\frac{918350}{30}-174.67^2= 102.06 \\mbox{ cm}^2,$$\nand the standard deviation is $s=\\sqrt{102.06} = 10.1$ cm.\nThis value is quite small compared to the range of the variable, that goes from 150 to 200 cm, therefore the distribution of heights has little dispersion and the mean is very representative.\nCoefficient of variation Both, variance and standard deviation, have units and that makes difficult to interpret them, specially when comparing distributions of variables with different units.\nFor that reason it is also common to use the following dispersion measure that has no units.\n Definition - Sample coefficient of variation $cv$. The sample coefficient of variation of a variable $X$ is the quotient between the sample standard deviation and the absolute value of the sample mean.\n$$cv = \\frac{s}{|\\bar x|}$$\n   The coefficient of variation measures the relative dispersion of data around the sample mean.\nAs it has no units, it is easier to interpret: The higher the coefficient of variation is, the higher the relative dispersion with respect to the mean and the less representative the mean is.\n  The coefficient of variation it is very helpful to compare dispersion in distributions of different variables, even if variables have different units.\nExample. In the sample of the number of children, where the mean was $\\bar x=1.76$ and the standard deviation was $s=0.8616$ children, the coefficient of variation is\n$$cv = \\frac{s}{|\\bar x|} = \\frac{0.8616}{|1.76|} = 0.49.$$\nIn the sample of heights, where the mean was $\\bar x=174.67$ cm and the standard deviation was $s=10.1$ cm, the coefficient of variation is\n$$cv = \\frac{s}{|\\bar x|} = \\frac{10.1}{|174.67|} = 0.06.$$\nThis means that the relative dispersion in the heights distribution is lower than in the number of children distribution, and consequently the mean of height is most representative than the mean of number of children.\nShape statistics They are measures that describe the shape of the distribution.\nIn particular, the most important aspects are:\nSymmetry It measures the symmetry of the distribution with respect to the mean. The statistics most used is the coefficient of skewness.\nKurtosis: It measures the concentration of data around the mean of the distribution. The statistics most used is the coefficient of kurtosis.\nCoefficient of skewness  Definition - Sample coefficient of skewness $g_1$. The sample coefficient of skewness of a variable $X$ is the average of the deviations of values from the sample mean to cube, divided by the standard deviation to cube.\n$$g_1 = \\frac{\\sum (x_i-\\bar x)^3 n_i/n}{s^3} = \\frac{\\sum (x_i-\\bar x)^3 f_i}{s^3}$$\n   The coefficient of skewness measures the symmetric or skewness of the distribution, that is, how many values in the sample are above or below the mean and how far from it.\n $g_1=0$ indicates that there are the same number of values in the sample above and below the mean and equally deviated from it, and the distribution is symmetrical.   $g_1\u0026lt;0$ indicates that there are more values above the mean than below it, but the values below are further from it, and the distribution is left-skewed (it has longer tail to the left).   $g_1\u0026gt;0$ indicates that there are more values below the mean than above it, but the values above are further from it, and the distribution is right-skewed (it has longer tail to the right).    Example - Grouped data. Using the frequency table of the sample with the heights of students and adding a new column with the deviations from the mean $\\bar x = 174.67$ cm to cube, we get\n$$ \\begin{array}{crrrr} \\hline X \u0026amp; x_i \u0026amp; n_i \u0026amp; x_i-\\bar x \u0026amp; (x_i-\\bar x)^3 n_i \\newline \\hline (150,160] \u0026amp; 155 \u0026amp; 2 \u0026amp; -19.67 \u0026amp; -15221.00\\newline (160,170] \u0026amp; 165 \u0026amp; 8 \u0026amp; -9.67 \u0026amp; -7233.85\\newline (170,180] \u0026amp; 175 \u0026amp; 11 \u0026amp; 0.33 \u0026amp; 0.40\\newline (180,190] \u0026amp; 185 \u0026amp; 7 \u0026amp; 10.33 \u0026amp; 7716.12\\newline (190,200] \u0026amp; 195 \u0026amp; 2 \u0026amp; 20.33 \u0026amp; 16805.14\\newline \\hline \\sum \u0026amp; \u0026amp; 30 \u0026amp; \u0026amp; 2066.81 \\newline \\hline \\end{array} $$\n$$g_1 = \\frac{\\sum (x_i-\\bar x)^3n_i/n}{s^3} = \\frac{2066.81/30}{10.1^3} = 0.07.$$\nAs it is close to 0, that means that the distribution of heights is fairly symmetrical.\nCoefficient of kurtosis  Definition - Sample coefficient of kurtosis $g_2$ The sample coefficient of kurtosis of a variable $X$ is the average of the deviations of values from the sample mean to the fourth power, divided by the standard deviation to the fourth power and minus 3.\n$$g_2 = \\frac{\\sum (x_i-\\bar x)^4 n_i/n}{s^4}-3 = \\frac{\\sum (x_i-\\bar x)^4 f_i}{s^4}-3$$\n   The coefficient of kurtosis measures the concentration of data around the mean and the length of tails of distribution. The normal (Gaussian bell-shaped) distribution is taken as a reference.\n $g_2=0$ indicates that the kurtosis is normal, that is, the concentration of values around the mean is the same than in a Gaussian bell-shaped distribution (mesokurtic).   $g_2\u0026lt;0$ indicates that the kurtosis is less than normal, that is, the concentration of values around the mean is less than in a Gaussian bell-shaped distribution (platykurtic).   $g_2\u0026gt;0$ indicates that the kurtosis is greater than normal, that is, the concentration of values around the mean is greater than in a Gaussian bell-shaped distribution (leptokurtic).    Example - Grouped data. Using the frequency table of the sample with the heights of students and adding a new column with the deviations from the mean $\\bar x = 174.67$ cm to the fourth power, we get\n$$ \\begin{array}{rrrrr} \\hline X \u0026amp; x_i \u0026amp; n_i \u0026amp; x_i-\\bar x \u0026amp; (x_i-\\bar x)^4 n_i\\newline \\hline (150,160] \u0026amp; 155 \u0026amp; 2 \u0026amp; -19.67 \u0026amp; 299396.99\\newline (160,170] \u0026amp; 165 \u0026amp; 8 \u0026amp; -9.67 \u0026amp; 69951.31\\newline (170,180] \u0026amp; 175 \u0026amp; 11 \u0026amp; 0.33 \u0026amp; 0.13\\newline (180,190] \u0026amp; 185 \u0026amp; 7 \u0026amp; 10.33 \u0026amp; 79707.53\\newline (190,200] \u0026amp; 195 \u0026amp; 2 \u0026amp; 20.33 \u0026amp; 341648.49\\newline \\hline \\sum \u0026amp; \u0026amp; 30 \u0026amp; \u0026amp; 790704.45 \\newline \\hline \\end{array} $$\n$$g_2 = \\frac{\\sum (x_i-\\bar x)^4n_i/n}{s^4} - 3 = \\frac{790704.45/30}{10.1^4}-3 = -0.47.$$\nAs it is a negative value but not too far from 0, that means that the distribution of heights is a little bit platykurtic.\nAs we will see in the chapters of inferential statistics, many of the statistical test can only be applied to normal (bell-shaped) populations.\nNormal distributions are symmetrical and mesokurtic, and therefore, their coefficients of symmetry and kurtosis are equal to 0. So, a way of checking if a sample comes from a normal population is looking how far are the coefficients of skewness and kurtosis from 0.\n In general, the normality of population is rejected when $g_1$ or $g_2$ are outside the interval $[-2,2]$.   In that case, is common to apply a transformation to the variable to correct non-normality.\nNon-normal distributions Non-normal right-skewed distribution An example of left-skewed distribution is the household income.\nNon-normal left-skewed distribution An example of left-skewed distribution is the age at death.\ndistribution Non-normal bimodal distribution An example of left-skewed distribution is the age at death.\nVariable transformations In many cases, the raw sample data are transformed to correct non-normality of distribution or just to get a more appropriate scale.\nFor example, if we are working with heights in metres and a sample contains the following values:\n$$ 1.75 \\mbox{ m}, 1.65 \\mbox{ m}, 1.80 \\mbox{ m}, $$\nit is possible to avoid decimals multiplying by 100, that is, changing from metres to centimetres:\n$$ 175 \\mbox{ cm}, 165 \\mbox{ cm}, 180 \\mbox{ cm}, $$\nAnd it is also possible to reduce the magnitude of data subtracting the minimum value in the sample, in this case 165 cm:\n$$ 10 \\mbox{ cm}, 0 \\mbox{ cm}, 15 \\mbox{ cm}. $$\nIt is obvious that these data are easier to work with than the original ones. In essences, what it is been done is to apply the following transformation to the data:\n$$Y= 100X-165$$\nLinear transformations One of the most common transformations is the linear transformation:\n$$Y=a+bX.$$\nFor a linear transformation, the mean and the standard deviation of the transformed variable are\n$$ \\begin{aligned} \\bar y \u0026amp;= a+ b\\bar x,\\newline s_{y} \u0026amp;= |b|s_{x} \\end{aligned} $$\nAdditionally, the coefficient of kurtosis does not change and the coefficient of skewness changes only the sign if $b$ is negative.\nStandardization and standard scores One of the most common linear transformations is the standardization.\n Definition - Standardized variable and standard scores. The standardized variable of a variable $X$ is the variable that results from subtracting the mean from $X$ and dividing it by the standard deviation\n$$Z=\\frac{X-\\bar x}{s_{x}}.$$\nFor each value $x_i$ of the sample, the standard score is the value that results of applying the standardization transformation\n$$z_i=\\frac{x_i-\\bar x}{s_{x}}.$$\n   The standard score is the number of standard deviations a value is above or below the mean, and it is useful to avoid the dependency of the variable from its measurement units. This helps, for instance, to compare values from different variables or samples.   The standardized variable always has mean 0 and standard deviation 1.\n$$\\bar z = 0 \\qquad s_{z} = 1$$\nExample. The grades of 5 students in 2 subjects are\n$$ \\begin{array}{rccccccccc} \\mbox{Student:} \u0026amp; 1 \u0026amp; 2 \u0026amp; 3 \u0026amp; 4 \u0026amp; 5 \u0026amp; \\newline \\hline X: \u0026amp; 2 \u0026amp; 5 \u0026amp; 4 \u0026amp; \\color{red} 8 \u0026amp; 6 \u0026amp; \\qquad \u0026amp; \\bar x = 5 \u0026amp; \\quad s_x = 2\\newline Y: \u0026amp; 1 \u0026amp; 9 \u0026amp; \\color{red} 8 \u0026amp; 5 \u0026amp; 2 \u0026amp; \\qquad \u0026amp; \\bar y = 5 \u0026amp; \\quad s_y = 3.16\\newline \\hline \\end{array} $$\nDid the fourth student get the same performance in subject $X$ than the third student in subject $Y$?\nIt might seem that both students had the same performance in every subject because they have the same grade, but in order to get the performance of every student relative to the group of students, the dispersion of grades in every subject must be considered. For that reason it is better to use the standard score as a measure of relative performance.\n$$ \\begin{array}{cccccc} \\mbox{Student:} \u0026amp; 1 \u0026amp; 2 \u0026amp; 3 \u0026amp; 4 \u0026amp; 5\\newline \\hline X: \u0026amp; -1.50 \u0026amp; 0.00 \u0026amp; -0.50 \u0026amp; \\color{red}{1.50} \u0026amp; 0.50 \\newline Y: \u0026amp; -1.26 \u0026amp; 1.26 \u0026amp; \\color{red}{0.95} \u0026amp; 0.00 \u0026amp; -0.95\\newline \\hline \\end{array} $$\nThat is, the student with an 8 in $X$ is $1.5$ times the standard deviation above the mean of $X$, while the student with an 8 in $Y$ is only $0.95$ times the standard deviation above the mean of $Y$. Therefore, the first student had a higher performance in $X$ than the second in $Y$.\nFollowing with this example and considering both subjects, which is the best student?\nIf we only consider the sum of grades\n$$\\begin{array}{rccccc} \\mbox{Student:} \u0026amp; 1 \u0026amp; 2 \u0026amp; 3 \u0026amp; 4 \u0026amp; 5\\newline \\hline X: \u0026amp; 2 \u0026amp; 5 \u0026amp; 4 \u0026amp; 8 \u0026amp; 6 \\newline Y: \u0026amp; 1 \u0026amp; 9 \u0026amp; 8 \u0026amp; 5 \u0026amp; 2 \\newline \\hline \\sum \u0026amp; 3 \u0026amp; \\color{red}{14} \u0026amp; 12 \u0026amp; 13 \u0026amp; 8 \\end{array} $$\nthe best student is the second one.\nBut if the relative performance is considered, taking the standard scores\n$$ \\begin{array}{rccccc} \\mbox{Student:} \u0026amp; 1 \u0026amp; 2 \u0026amp; 3 \u0026amp; 4 \u0026amp; 5\\newline \\hline X: \u0026amp; -1.50 \u0026amp; 0.00 \u0026amp; -0.50 \u0026amp; 1.50 \u0026amp; 0.50 \\newline Y: \u0026amp; -1.26 \u0026amp; 1.26 \u0026amp; 0.95 \u0026amp; 0.00 \u0026amp; -0.95\\newline \\hline \\sum \u0026amp; -2.76 \u0026amp; 1.26 \u0026amp; 0.45 \u0026amp; \\color{red}{1.5} \u0026amp; -0.45 \\end{array} $$\nthe best student is the fourth one.\nNon-linear transformations Non-linear transformations are also common to correct non-normality of distributions.\nThe square transformation $Y=X^2$ compresses small values and expand large values. So, it is used to correct left-skewed distributions.\nThe square root transformation $Y=\\sqrt x$, the logarithmic transformation $Y= \\log X$ and the inverse transformation $Y=1/X$ compress large values and expand small values. So, they are used to correct right-skewed distributions.\nFactors Sometimes it is interesting to describe the frequency distribution of the main variable for different subsamples corresponding to the categories of another variable known as classificatory variable or factor.\nExample. Dividing the sample of heights by gender we get two subsamples\n$$ \\begin{array}{lll} \\hline \\mbox{Females} \u0026amp; \u0026amp; 173, 158, 174, 166, 162, 177, 165, 154, 166, 182, 169, 172, 170, 168. \\newline \\mbox{Males} \u0026amp; \u0026amp; 179, 181, 172, 194, 185, 187, 198, 178, 188, 171, 175, 167, 186, 172, 176, 187. \\newline \\hline \\end{array} $$\nComparing distributions for the levels of a factor Usually factors allow to compare the distribution of the main variable for every category of the factor.\nExample.

A scalar is a number that expresses a magnitude without direction.   Example. The height or weight of a person, the temperature of a gas or the time it takes a vehicle to travel a distance.\nHowever, there are other phenomena that cannot be described adequately by a scalar. If, for instance, a sailor wants to head for seaport and only knows the intensity of wind, he will not know what direction to take. The description of wind requires two elements: intensity and direction.\nVectors  Definition - Vector. A vector is a number that expresses a magnitude and has associated an orientation and a sense.   Example. The velocity of a vehicle or the force applied to an object.\nGeometrically, a vector is represented by an directed line segment, that is, an arrow.\nVector representation An oriented segment can be located in different places in a Cartesian space. However, regardless of where it is located, if the length and the direction of the segment does not change, the segment represents always the same vector.\nThis allows to represent all vectors with the same origin, the origin of the Cartesian coordinate system. Thus, a vector can be represented by the Cartesian coordinates of its final end in any Euclidean space.\nVector from two points Given two points $P$ and $Q$ of a Cartesian space, the vector that starts at $P$ and ends at $Q$ has coordinates $\\vec{PQ}=Q-P$.\nExample. Given the points $P=(1,1)$ and $Q=(3,4)$ in the real plane $\\mathbb{R}^2$, the coordinates of the vector that start at $P$ and ends at $Q$ are $$\\vec{PQ} = Q-P = (3,4)-(1,1) = (3-2,4-1) = (2,3).$$\nModule of a vector  Definition - Module of a vector. Given a vector $\\mathbf{v}=(v_1,\\cdots,v_n)$ in $\\mathbb{R}^n$, the module of $\\mathbf{v}$ is $$|\\mathbf{v}| = \\sqrt{v_1^2+ \\cdots + v_n^2}.$$   The module of a vector coincides with the length of the segment that represents the vector.\nExamples. Let $\\mathbf{u}=(3,4)$ be a vector in $\\mathbb{R}^2$, then its module is $$|\\mathbf{u}| = \\sqrt{3^2+4^2} = \\sqrt{25} = 5$$\nLet $\\mathbf{v}=(4,7,4)$ be a vector in $\\mathbb{R}^3$, then its module is $$|\\mathbf{v}| = \\sqrt{4^2+7^2+4^2} = \\sqrt{81} = 9$$\nUnit vectors  Definition - Unit vector. A vector $\\mathbf{v}$ in $\\mathbb{R}^n$ is a unit vector if its module is one, that is, $\\vert v\\vert=1$.   The unit vectors with the direction of the coordinate axes are of special importance and they form the standard basis.\nIn $\\mathbb{R}^2$ the standard basis is formed by two vectors $\\mathbf{i}=(1,0)$ and $\\mathbf{j}=(0,1)$.\nIn $\\mathbb{R}^3$ the standard basis is formed by three vectors $\\mathbf{i}=(1,0,0)$, $\\mathbf{j}=(0,1,0)$ and $\\mathbf{k}=(0,0,1)$.\nSum of two vectors  Definition - Sum of two vectors. Given two vectors $\\mathbf{u}=(u_1,\\cdots,u_n)$ y $\\mathbf{v}=(v_1,\\cdots,v_n)$ de $\\mathbb{R}^n$, the sum of $\\mathbf{u}$ and $\\mathbf{v}$ is\n$$\\mathbf{u}+\\mathbf{v} = (u_1+v_1,\\ldots, u_n+v_n).$$\n  Example. Let $\\mathbf{u}=(3,1)$ and $\\mathbf{v}=(2,3)$ two vectors in $\\mathbb{R}^2$, then the sum of them is $$\\mathbf{u}+\\mathbf{v} = (3+2,1+3) = (5,4).$$\nProduct of a vector by a scalar  Definition - Product of a vector by a scalar. Given a vector $\\mathbf{v}=(v_1,\\cdots,v_n)$ in $\\mathbb{R}^n$, and a scalar $a\\in \\mathbb{R}$, the product of $\\mathbf{v}$ by $a$ is\n$$a\\mathbf{v} = (av_1,\\ldots, av_n).$$\n  Example. Let $\\mathbf{v}=(2,1)$ a vector in $\\mathbb{R}^2$ and $a=2$ a scalar, then the product of $a$ by $\\mathbf{v}$ is $$a\\mathbf{v} = 2(2,1) = (4,2).$$\nExpressing a vector as a linear combination of the standard basis The sum of vectors and the product of vector by a scalar allow us to express any vector as a linear combination of the standard basis.\nIn $\\mathbb{R}^3$, for instance, a vector with coordinates $\\mathbf{v}=(v_1,v_2,v_3)$ can be expressed as the linear combination $$\\mathbf{v}=(v_1,v_2,v_3) = v_1\\mathbf{i}+v_2\\mathbf{j}+v_3\\mathbf{k}.$$\nDot product of two vectors  Definition - Dot product of two vectors. Given the vectors $\\mathbf{u}=(u_1,\\cdots,u_n)$ and $\\mathbf{v}=(v_1,\\cdots,v_n)$ in $\\mathbb{R}^n$, the dot product of $\\mathbf{u}$ and $\\mathbf{v}$ is\n$$\\mathbf{u}\\cdot \\mathbf{v} = u_1v_1 + \\cdots + u_nv_n.$$\n  Example. Let $\\mathbf{u}=(3,1)$ and $\\mathbf{v}=(2,3)$ two vectors in $\\mathbb{R}^2$, then the dot product of them is\n$$\\mathbf{u}\\cdot\\mathbf{v} = 3\\cdot 2 +1\\cdot 3 = 9.$$\n Theorem - Dot product. Given two vectors $\\mathbf{u}$ and $\\mathbf{v}$ in $\\mathbb{R}^n$, it holds that\n$$\\mathbf{u}\\cdot\\mathbf{v} = |\\mathbf{u}||\\mathbf{v}|\\cos\\alpha$$\nwhere $\\alpha$ is the angle between the vectors.\n  Parallel vectors  Definition - Parallel vectors. Two vectors $\\mathbf{u}$ and $\\mathbf{v}$ are parallel if there is a scalar $a\\in\\mathbb{R}$ such that\n$$\\mathbf{u} = a\\mathbf{v}.$$\n  Example. The vectors $\\mathbf{u}=(-4,2)$ and $\\mathbf{v}=(2,-1)$ in $\\mathbb{R}^2$ are parallel, as there is a scalar $-2$ such that $$\\mathbf{u}= (-4,2) = -2(2,-1) = -2\\mathbf{v}.$$\nOrthogonal and orthonormal vectors  Definition - Orthogonal and orthonormal vectors. Two vectors $\\mathbf{u}$ and $\\mathbf{v}$ are orthogonal if their dot product is zero,\n$$\\mathbf{u}\\cdot \\mathbf{v} = 0.$$\nIf in addition both vectors are unit vectors, $\\vert\\mathbf{u}\\vert=\\vert\\mathbf{v}\\vert=1$, then the vectors are orthonormal.\n   Orthogonal vectors are perpendicular, that is the angle between them is right.   Examples. The vectors $\\mathbf{u}=(2,1)$ and $\\mathbf{v}=(-2,4)$ in $\\mathbb{R}^2$ are orthogonal, as $$\\mathbf{u}\\mathbf{v} = 2\\cdot -2 +1\\cdot 4 = 0,$$ but they are not orthonormal since $|\\mathbf{u}| = \\sqrt{2^2+1^2} \\neq 1$ and $|\\mathbf{v}| = \\sqrt{-2^2+4^2} \\neq 1$.\nThe vectors $\\mathbf{i}=(1,0)$ and $\\mathbf{j}=(0,1)$ in $\\mathbb{R}^2$ are orthonormal, as $$\\mathbf{i}\\mathbf{j} = 1\\cdot 0 +0\\cdot 1 = 0, \\quad |\\mathbf{i}| = \\sqrt{1^2+0^2} = 1, \\quad |\\mathbf j| = \\sqrt{0^2+1^2} = 1.$$\nLines Vectorial equation of a straight line  Definition - Vectorial equation of a straight line. Given a point $P=(p_1,\\ldots,p_n)$ and a vector $\\mathbf{v}=(v_1,\\ldots,v_n)$ of $\\mathbb{R}^n$, the vectorial equation of the line $l$ that passes through the point $P$ with the direction of $\\mathbf{v}$ is\n$$l: X= P + t\\mathbf{v} = (p_1,\\ldots,p_n)+t(v_1,\\ldots,v_n) = (p_1+tv_1,\\ldots,p_n+tv_n)$$\nwith $t\\in\\mathbb{R}.$\n  Example. Let $l$ the line of $\\mathbb{R}^3$ that goes through $P=(1,1,2)$ with the direction of $\\mathbf{v}=(3,1,2)$, then the vectorial equation of $l$ is $$ l : X= P + t\\mathbf{v} = (1,1,2)+t(3,1,2) = (1+3t,1+t,2+2t)\\quad t\\in\\mathbb{R}. $$\nParametric and Cartesian equations of a line From the vectorial equation of a line $l: X=P + t\\mathbf{v}=(p_1+tv_1,\\ldots,p_n+tv_n)$ is easy to obtain the coordinates of the the points of the line with $n$ parametric equations\n$$x_1(t)=p_1+tv_1, \\ldots, x_n(t)=p_n+tv_n$$\nfrom where, if $\\mathbf{v}$ is a vector with non-null coordinates ($v_i\\neq 0$ $\\forall i$), we can solve for $t$ and equal the equations getting the Cartesian equations\n$$\\frac{x_1-p_1}{v_1}=\\cdots = \\frac{x_n-p_n}{v_n}$$\nExample. Given a line with vectorial equation $l: X=(1,1,2)+t(3,1,2) =(1+3t,1+t,2+2t)$ in $\\mathbb{R^3}$, its parametric equations are\n$$x(t) = 1+3t, \\quad y(t)=1+t, \\quad z(t)=2+2t,$$ and the Cartesian equations are $$\\frac{x-1}{3}=\\frac{y-1}{1}=\\frac{z-2}{2}$$\nPoint-slope equation of a line in the plane In the particular case of the real plane $\\mathbb{R}^2$, if we have a line with vectorial equation $l: X=P+t\\mathbf{v}=(x_0,y_0)+t(a,b) = (x_0+ta,y_0+tb)$, its parametric equations are\n$$x(t)=x_0+ta,\\quad y(t)=y_0+tb$$\nand its Cartesian equation is\n$$\\frac{x-x_0}{a} = \\frac{y-y_0}{b}.$$\nFrom this, moving $b$ to the other side of the equation, we get $$y-y_0 = \\frac{b}{a}(x-x_0),$$ or renaming $m=b/a$,\n$$y-y_0=m(x-x_0).$$\nThis equation is known as the point-slope equation of the line.\nSlope of a line in the plane  Definition - Slope of a line in the plane. Given a line $l: X=P+t\\mathbf{v}$ in the real plane $\\mathbb{R}^2$, with direction vector $\\mathbf{v}=(a,b)$, the slope of $l$ is $b/a$.   Recall that given two points $P=(x_1,y_1)$ y $Q=(x_2,y_2)$ on the line $l$, we can take as a direction vector the vector from $P$ to $Q$, with coordinates $\\vec{PQ}=Q-P=(x_2-x_1,y_2-y_1)$. Thus, the slope of $l$ is $\\dfrac{y_2-y_1}{x_2-x_1}$, that is, the ratio between the changes in the vertical and horizontal axes.\nPlanes Vector equation of a plane in space To get the equation of a plane in the real space $\\mathbb{R}^3$ we can take a point of the plane $P=(x_0,y_0,z_0)$ and an orthogonal vector to the plane $\\mathbf{v}=(a,b,c)$. Then, any point $Q=(x,y,z)$ of the plane satisfies that the vector $\\vec{PQ} = (x-x_0,y-y_0,z-z_0)$ is orthogonal to $\\mathbf{v}$, and therefore their dot product is zero.\n Definition - Vector equation of a plane in space. Given a point $P=(v_0,y_0,z_0)$ an a vector $\\mathbf{v}=(a,b,c)$ in the real space $\\mathbb{R}^3$, the vector equation of the plane that passes through $P$ orthogonal to $\\mathbf{v}=(a,b,c)$ is\n$$ \\begin{align*} \\vec{PQ}\\cdot\\mathbf{v} \u0026amp;= (x-x_0,y-y_0,z-z_0)(a,b,c) =\\newline \u0026amp;= a(x-x_0)+b(y-y_0)+c(z-z_0) = 0. \\end{align*} $$\n  Scalar equation of a plane in space From the vector equation of the plane we can get\n$$a(x-x_0)+b(y-y_0)+c(z-z_0) = 0 \\Leftrightarrow ax+by+cz=ax_0+by_0+cz_0,$$\nthat, renaming $d=ax_0+by_0+cz_0$, can be written as\n$$ax+by+cz=d,$$\nand is known as the scalar equation of the plane.\nExample. Given the point $P=(2,1,1)$ and the vector $\\mathbf{v}=(2,1,2)$, the vector equation of the plane that passes through $P$ and is orthogonal to $\\mathbf{v}$ is\n$$(x-2,y-1,z-1)(2,1,2)=2(x-2)+(y-1)+2(z-1)=0,$$\nand its scalar equation is\n$$2x+y+2z=7.$$\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1600206500,"objectID":"22fd1e7f4350c0e3490590a757816c43","permalink":"/en/teaching/calculus/manual/analytic-geometry/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/en/teaching/calculus/manual/analytic-geometry/","section":"teaching","summary":"Scalars and Vectors Scalars Some phenomena of Nature can be described by a number and a unit of measurement.\n Definition - Scalar.

A spreadsheet is a program that allows the user to enter data and make calculations with them in a grid layout.\nThere are a lot of programs for managing spreadsheets but the best-known are Excel, in the Microsoft Office suite, and Calc, in the LibreOffice suite. Although Calc is opensource, with all the advantages associated therewith, Excel is by far the most widespread and mature spreadsheet, thus this manual covers Excel 2010. However, some of the procedures and methods explained in this manual are also valid for Calc.\nExcel 2010 main window The figure below shows a screenshot of the Excel 2010 main window where the different parts of the window have been highlighted.\nExcel 2010 ribbon The top ribbon of Excel 2010 contains a lot of buttons that perform different actions. These buttons are arranged in panels, and the panels are arranged in tabs. The main ribbon tabs are:\nFile â Performs file management tasks (new file, open file, save file, print file, etc.). It also contains general configuration options and help.\nHome â Common tools (clipboard, fonts, alignment, numbers format, insert rows and columns, etc.)\nInsert â Insert objects in the sheet (tables, illustrations, charts, hyperlinks, text, equations, etc.)\nPage Layout â Configure the printing (page setup, scale, themes, etc. )\nFormulas â Functions arranged in categories and formula auditing.\nData â Working with databases (import data, connection with databases, sort and filter data, data validation, etc.)\nReview â Spelling, commenting, protecting and sharing sheets.\nView â How Excel appears on screen (custom windows, grids lines, zoom, windows, etc. Does not affect printing).\nContextual tabs These tabs only appear in some contexts, as for example, when creating a chart or a picture.\nChart design Allows to select the type of chart.\nChart layout Allows the user to insert and configure some parts of charts (title, axis, leyend, gridlines, etc.)\nChart format Allows the user to change the aspect of charts (height, width, font, colors, background, etc.)\nPicture Allows to modify images (borders, rotation, crop, color, filters, special effects, etc.)\nIn addition to these tabs, users can create their own tabs and customise them with buttons at their convenience.\nThere is also a quick access toolbar just above the ribbon that can be customised with the most common buttons.\nAccess dialogs When you click the right bottom corner of any panel, the corresponding dialog is shown where all the related options are available.\nExample. Figure below shows the font dialog with all the options related to fonts (font family, font style, font size, etc.)\nContextual menu Clicking the right button of the mouse (right-clicking) a contextual menu is shown with some buttons or options to perform actions in that context. This menu has different options depending on the part of the windows that is clicked.\nExample. Figure below shows the contextual menu showed right-clicking any cell.\nWorkbooks, worksheets, rows, columns and cells An Excel file is a workbook with several worksheets that are two dimensional tables divided in columns and rows. The intersection of a column with a row is a cell that is where data are entered. Sheets have a maximum of 16,384 columns and 1,048,576 rows.\nEach worksheet has a name and they are arranged in tabs at the bottom. Columns and rows also have names; columns are named with letters at the top of the column and rows with numbers to the left of the row. This way each cell is identified by the name of the worksheet, the name of the column and the name of the row where it is located, and cell names follow the pattern: name-of-worksheet ! column-name row-name. However, to refer to any cell in the active worksheet, the worksheet name may be omitted.\nExample. The name of the selected cell in the figure below is Sheet1!C4.\nThe names of rows and columns can not be changed, but worksheet names can be changed by double-clicking on the name and typing the new name.\nRanges of cells A range of cells is a rectangular block of adjacent cells that is identified by top-left cell and the bottom-right cell separated by a colon, following the pattern top-left-cell-name:bottom-right-cell-name.\nExample. In the figure below the range B3:E5 is selected.\nSelecting cells, rows, columns, ranges and worksheets To select a cell just click it. To select a row click the header of the row or press the keys Shift+Spacebar. To select a column click the header of the column or press the keys Ctrl+Spacebar. To select a range click one corner cell and drag the cursor over the desired cells. To select the whole worksheet click the top-left corner of the worksheet or press the keys Ctrl+A.\nExample. The animation below shows how to select cell C3, then row 3, then column C, then range B3:D7 and finally the whole worksheet.\nData edition Insert data Data are entered into the cells by activating the cell (clicking it) and typing directly in the cell or in the input bar.\nExample. The animation below shows how to enter the text \u0026lsquo;Excel\u0026rsquo; in cell B2 and the number 2010 in cell C2, and then how to change the number of cell C2 to 2013.\nExcel has a smart autocomplete feature that proposes some options for completing the typed data.\nDelete data To delete the content of a cell or a range of cells simply select the it and press Supr key. It is also possible to delete the cell contents with the button Clear All.\nRemove cells, rows, columns and worksheets To remove a whole cell (not only the content), right-click the cell and select the option Delete.... In the dialog that appears select Shift cells left if you want the cells to the left of the removed cell to move to the left to fill the gap, or Shift cells up if you want the cells below the removed cell to move up to fill the gap.\nTo remove a whole row, right-click the header of the row and select the option Delete....\nTo remove a whole column, right-click the header of the column and select the option Delete....\nTo remove a worksheet, right-click the tab with the name of the worksheet and select the option Delete.... Warning: Removing worksheets cannot be undone!\nExample. This shows how to remove a cell, a row, a column and a worksheet.\nInsert cells, rows, columns and worksheets To insert a new cell in a position, right-click the current cell in that position and select the option Insert.... In the dialog that appears select Shift cells right if you want to move the cells to the right to make a gap for the new cell, or Shift cells down if you want to move the cells down to make a gap for the new cell.\nTo insert a new row, right-click the header of the row above which you want to insert the new row and select Insert.\nTo insert a new column, right-click the header of the column to the left of which you want to insert the new column and select Insert.\nTo insert a new worksheet, right-click the tab with the name of the worksheet to the left of which you want to insert the new worksheet and select Insert. In the dialog that appears select `Worksheet'.\nExample. The animation below shows how to insert a cell, a row, a column and a worksheet.\nCut, copy and paste Like in many other Windows applications, you can use the clipboard to cut, copy and paste cells, rows, columns and ranges contents.\nTo cut or copy a cell, row, column or range, right-click it and select the option Cut or Copy respectively, or press the keys Ctrl+x or Ctrl+c respectively. Both options copy the content of the cell, row, column or range to the clipboard, but the difference between cut and copy is that cut deletes the content from the current cell, row, column or range, while copy does not.\nTo paste the content of the clipboard in a new cell, row, column or range, select the cell or the first cell of the row, column or range and click the button Paste or press the keys Ctrl+v.\nExample. The animation below shows how to copy and paste the content of a cell, a row, a column and a range and a worksheet.\nAutofill A useful feature of Excel is the autofill of cells following a serie or pattern. In some cases, like for example dates, it is enough to write the content of the first cell and then click the bottom-right corner of the cell and drag the cursor over the column or row to fill the cells with the subsequent dates.\nFor numbers or text, this action replicates the content of the first cell in the others. To autofill with a series of numbers it is necessary to enter the first two numbers of the series in two consecutive cells, then select both cells, click the bottom-left corner and drag the cursor over the column or row to fill the cells with the numbers following in the series.\nExample. The animation below shows how to replicate the content of cell A1 to range A2:A10, then how to auto fill the range B1:B10 with the dates following date in cell B1, and finally how to auto fill the range C1:C10 with the series of even numbers.\n-- Undo and redo In the quick access toolbar there are buttons Undo and Redo . The Undo button undoes the last data edition action performed and the Redo button reverses the last undone action. If you press the undo button several $n$ times, it undoes the last $n$ actions, and the same happens with the redo button.\nExample. The animation below shows how to remove the content of cell B2, then change the content of cell C2 two times, then undo that action and finally redo the same actions.\nColumn and row sizing Column width and row height can be easily changed. To change the width of a column click the line between the column you want to resize and the next column in the column header, and then drag the pointer mouse to increase or reduce the column width. If you double-click this line the column width will auto resize to the width of the widest cell content in the column.\nIn a similar way, to change the height of a row click the line between the row you want to resize and the next row in the row header, and then drag the pointer mouse to increase or reduce the row height. If you double-click this line the row height will auto resize to the height of the highest cell content in the row.\nExample. The animation below shows how to resize the width of column C and the height of row 3 to fit the content of cell C3.\n-- File management Data of workbooks are stored in files. Although Excel makes backups copies of your work regularly, it is good practice to save your work in files regularly.\nSave a file To save the content of a workbook in a file press the tab File and select the option Save. In the dialog that appears type the file name and select the storage unit and folder where you want to save the file. The default extension for Excel 2010 file names is xlsx.\nOpen a file To open an Excel file press the tab File and select the option Open. In the dialog that appears select the storage unit and folder where the file is saved and the file to open, and press the button Open.\nCreate a new workbook To create a new workbook press the tab File and select the option New. In the dialog that appears select Blank workbook. It is possible to create new workbooks from predefined templates.\nClose a workbook To close an open workbook press the tab File and select the option Close. If the last changes in the workbook haven\u0026rsquo;t been saved, a warning will appear allowing you to save the file before to close it.\nExporting and importing data Excel can export and import data in many formats. One of the most common formats is csv (comma separated values). In this format data is saved in a plain text file one row per line and separating columns with commas or semicolons.\nExport to csv format To export a worksheet to csv format file, click the option Save as of the ribbon\u0026rsquo;s File tab.

To get help about any issue in Excel click the option Help in the Help tab of the ribbon, and then click Microsoft Office Help. This shows a browser where you can enter some key words and Excel will search topics related to these words and present the search results in a list. Clicking the desired topic will show you help info about that topic.\nExample. The figure below shows the help search results for the word \u0026ldquo;cell\u0026rdquo;.\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1600206500,"objectID":"0ef4310edc3a4ddaec8751dec5ce4428","permalink":"/en/teaching/excel/manual/introduction/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/en/teaching/excel/manual/introduction/","section":"teaching","summary":" ","tags":["Excel"],"title":"Introduction","type":"book"},{"authors":null,"categories":["Statistics","Biostatistics"],"content":"In the last chapter we saw how to describe the distribution of a single variable in a sample. However, in most cases, studies require to describe several variables that are often related. For instance, a nutritional study should consider all the variables that could be related to the weight, as height, age, gender, smoking, diet, physic exercise, etc.\nTo understand a phenomenon that involve several variables is not enough to study every variable by its own. We have to study all the variables together to describe how they interact and the type of relation among them.\nUsually in a dependency study there is a dependent variable $Y$ that it is supposed to be influenced by a set of variables $X_1,\\ldots,X_n$ known as independent variables. The simpler case is a simple dependency study when there is only one independent variable, that is the case covered in this chapter.\nJoint distribution Joint frequencies To study the relation between two variables $X$ and $Y$, we have to study the joint distribution of the two-dimensional variable $(X,Y)$, whose values are pairs $(x_i,y_j)$ where the first element is a value of $X$ and the second a value of $Y$.\n Definition - Joint sample frequencies. Given a sample of $n$ values and a two-dimensional variable $(X,Y)$, for every value of the variable $(x_i,y_j)$ is defined:\n Absolute frequency $n_{ij}$: Is the number of times that the pair $(x_i,y_j)$ appears in the sample. Relative frequency $f_{ij}$: Is the proportion of times that the pair $(x_i,y_j)$ appears in the sample.  $$f_{ij}=\\frac{n_{ij}}{n}.$$\n   For two-dimensional variables it make no sense cumulative frequencies.   Joint frequency distribution The values of the two-dimensional variable with their frequencies is known as joint frequency distribution, and is represented in a joint frequency table.\n$$\\begin{array}{|c|ccccc|} \\hline X\\backslash Y \u0026amp; y_1 \u0026amp; \\cdots \u0026amp; y_j \u0026amp; \\cdots \u0026amp; y_q \\newline \\hline x_1 \u0026amp; n_{11} \u0026amp; \\cdots \u0026amp; n_{1j} \u0026amp; \\cdots \u0026amp; n_{1q} \\newline \\vdots \u0026amp; \\vdots \u0026amp; \\vdots \u0026amp; \\vdots \u0026amp; \\vdots \u0026amp; \\vdots \\newline x_i \u0026amp; n_{i1} \u0026amp; \\cdots \u0026amp; n_{ij} \u0026amp; \\cdots \u0026amp; n_{iq} \\newline \\vdots \u0026amp; \\vdots \u0026amp; \\vdots \u0026amp; \\vdots \u0026amp; \\vdots \u0026amp; \\vdots \\newline x_p \u0026amp; n_{p1} \u0026amp; \\cdots \u0026amp; n_{pj} \u0026amp; \\cdots \u0026amp; n_{pq} \\newline \\hline \\end{array}$$\nExample (grouped data).

The part of Statistics in charge of constructing such a function is called regression, and the function is known as regression function or regression model.\nSimple regression models There are a lot of types of regression models. The most common models are shown in the table below.\n   Model Equation     Linear $y=a+bx$   Quadratic $y=a+bx+cx^2$   Cubic $y=a+bx+cx^2+dx^3$   Potential $y=a\\cdot x^b$   Exponential $y=e^{a+bx}$   Logarithmic $y=a+b\\log x$   Inverse $y=a+\\frac{b}{x}$   Sigmoidal $y=e^{a+\\frac{b}{x}}$    The model choice depends on the shape of the points cloud in the scatterplot.\nResiduals or predictive errors Once chosen the type of regression model, we have to determine which function of that family explains better the relation between the dependent and the independent variables, that is, the function that predicts better the dependent variable.\nThat function is the function that minimizes the distances from the observed values for $Y$ in the sample to the predicted values of the regression function. These distances are known as residuals or predictive errors.\n Definition - Residuals or predictive errors. Given a regression model $y=f(x)$ for a two-dimensional variable $(X,Y)$, the residual or predictive error for every pair $(x_i,y_j)$ of the sample is the difference between the observed value of the dependent variable $y_j$ and the predicted value of the regression function for $x_i$,$$e_{ij} = y_j-f(x_i).$$   Least squares fitting A way to get the regression function is the least squares method, that determines the function that minimizes the squared residuals.\n$$\\sum e_{ij}^2.$$\nFor a linear model $f(x) = a + bx$, the sum depends on two parameters,the intercept $a$, and the slope $b$ of the straight line,\n$$\\theta(a,b) = \\sum e_{ij}^2 =\\sum (y_j - f(x_i))^2 =\\sum (y_j-a-bx_i)^2.$$\nThis reduces the problem to determine the values of $a$ and $b$ that minimize this sum.\nTo solve the minimization problem, we have to set to zero the partial derivatives with respect to $a$ and $b$.\n$$ \\begin{aligned} \\frac{\\partial \\theta(a,b)}{\\partial a} \u0026amp;= \\frac{\\partial \\sum (y_j-a-bx_i)^2 }{\\partial a} =0 \\newline \\frac{\\partial \\theta(a,b)}{\\partial b} \u0026amp;= \\frac{\\partial \\sum (y_j-a-bx_i)^2 }{\\partial b} =0 \\end{aligned} $$\nAnd solving the equation system, we get\n$$a= \\bar y - \\frac{s_{xy}}{s_x^2}\\bar x \\qquad b=\\frac{s_{xy}}{s_x^2}$$\nThis values minimize the residuals on $Y$ and give us the optimal linear model.\nRegression line  Definition - Regression line. Given a sample of a two-dimensional variable $(X,Y)$, the regression line of $Y$ on $X$ is$$y = \\bar y +\\frac{s_{xy}}{s_x^2}(x-\\bar x).$$    The regression line of $Y$ on $X$ is the straight line that minimizes the predictive errors on $Y$, therefore it is the linear regression model that gives better predictions of $Y$.   Example. Using the previous sample of heights ($X$) and weights ($Y$) with the following statistics\n$$ \\begin{array}{lllll} \\bar x = 174.67 \\mbox{ cm} \u0026amp; \\quad \u0026amp; s^2_x = 102.06 \\mbox{ cm}^2 \u0026amp; \\quad \u0026amp; s_x = 10.1 \\mbox{ cm} \\newline \\bar y = 69.67 \\mbox{ Kg} \u0026amp; \u0026amp; s^2_y = 164.42 \\mbox{ Kg}^2 \u0026amp; \u0026amp; s_y = 12.82 \\mbox{ Kg} \\newline \u0026amp; \u0026amp; s_{xy} = 104.07 \\mbox{ cm$\\cdot$ Kg} \u0026amp; \u0026amp; \\end{array} $$\nthe regression line of weight on height is\n$$y = \\bar y +\\frac{s_{xy}}{s_x^2}(x-\\bar x) = 69.67+\\frac{104.07}{102.06}(x-174.67) = -108.49 +1.02 x$$\nAnd the regression line of height on weight is\n$$x = \\bar x +\\frac{s_{xy}}{s_y^2}(y-\\bar y) = 174.67+\\frac{104.07}{164.42}(y-69.67) = 130.78 + 0.63 y$$\n Observe that the regression lines are different!   Relative position of the regression lines Usually, the regression line of $Y$ on $X$ and the regression line of $X$ on $Y$ are not the same, but they always intersect in the mean point $(\\bar x,\\bar y)$.\nIf there is a perfect linear relation between the variables, then both regression lines are the same, as that line makes both $X$-residuals and $Y$-residuals zero.\nIf there is no linear relation between the variables, then both regression lines are constant and equals to the respective means,\n$$y = \\bar y,\\quad x = \\bar x.$$\nSo, they intersect perpendicularly.\nRegression coefficient The most important parameter of a regression line is the slope.\n Definition - Regression coefficient $b_{yx}$. Given a sample of a two-dimensional variable $(X,Y)$, the _regression coefficient_ of the regression line of $Y$ on $X$ is its slope,$$b_{yx} = \\frac{s_{xy}}{s_x^2}$$    The regression coefficient has always the same sign as the covariance.    It measures how the dependent variable changes in relation to the independent one according to the regression line. In particular, it gives the number of units that the dependent variable increases or decreases for every unit that the independent variable increases.   Example. In the sample of heights and weights, the regression line of weight on height was\n$$y=-108.49 +1.02 x.$$\nThus, the regression coefficient of weight on height is\n$$b_{yx}= 1.02 \\mbox{Kg/cm.}$$\nThat means that, according to the regression line of weight on height, the weight will increase $1.02$ Kg for every cm that the height increases.\nRegression predictions Usually the regression models are used to predict the dependent variable for some values of the independent variable.\nExample. In the sample of heights and weights, to predict the weight of a person with a height of 180 cm, we have to use the regression line of weight on height,\n$$y = -108.49 + 1.02 \\cdot 180 = 75.11 \\mbox{ Kg}.$$\nBut to predict the height of a person with a weight of 79 Kg, we have to use the regression line of height on weight,\n$$x = 130.78 + 0.63\\cdot 79 = 180.55 \\mbox{ cm}.$$\nHowever, how reliable are these predictions?\nCorrelation Once we have a regression model, in order to see if it is a good predictive model we have to assess the goodness of fit of the model and the strength of the of relation set by it. The part of Statistics in charge of this is correlation.\nThe correlation study the residuals of a regression model: the smaller the residuals, the greater the goodness of fit, and the stronger the relation set by the model.\nResidual variance To measure the goodness of fit of a regression model is common to use the residual variance.\n Definition - Sample residual variance $s_{ry}^2$. Given a regression model $y=f(x)$ of a two-dimensional variable $(X,Y)$, its _sample residual variance_ is the average of the squared residuals,\n$$s_{ry}^2 = \\frac{\\sum e_{ij}^2n_{ij}}{n} = \\frac{\\sum (y_j - f(x_i))^2n_{ij}}{n}.$$\n   The greater the residuals, the greater the residual variance and the smaller the goodness of fit.\nWhen the linear relation is perfect, the residuals are zero and the residual variance is zero. Conversely, when there are no relation, the residuals coincide with deviations from the mean, and the residual variance is equal to the variance of the dependent variable.\n$$0\\leq s_{ry}^2\\leq s_y^2$$\n  Explained and non-explained variation Coefficient of determination From the residual variance is possible to define another correlation statistic easier to interpret.\n Definition - Sample coefficient of determination $r^2$. Given a regression model $y=f(x)$ of a two-dimensional variable $(X,Y)$, its coefficient of determination is$$r^2 = 1- \\frac{s_{ry}^2}{s_y^2}$$    As the residual variance ranges from 0 to $s_y^2$, we have\n$$0\\leq r^2\\leq 1$$\n   The greater $r^2$ is, the greater the goodness of fit of the regression model, and the more reliable will its predictions be. In particular,\n If $r^2 =0$ then there is no relation as set by the regression model. If $r^2=1$ then the relation set by the model is perfect.     When the regression model is linear, the coefficient of determination can be computed with this formula\n$$ r^2 = \\frac{s_{xy}^2}{s_x^2s_y^2}.$$\n   DemostraciÃ³n  When the fitted model is the regression line, the the residual variance is\n$$ \\begin{aligned} s_{ry}^2 \u0026amp; = \\sum e_{ij}^2f_{ij} = \\sum (y_j - f(x_i))^2f_{ij} = \\sum \\left(y_j - \\bar y -\\frac{s_{xy}}{s_x^2}(x_i-\\bar x) \\right)^2f_{ij}= \\newline \u0026amp; = \\sum \\left((y_j - \\bar y)^2 +\\frac{s_{xy}^2}{s_x^4}(x_i-\\bar x)^2 - 2\\frac{s_{xy}}{s_x^2}(x_i-\\bar x)(y_j -\\bar y)\\right)f_{ij} = \\newline \u0026amp; = \\sum (y_j - \\bar y)^2f_{ij} +\\frac{s_{xy}^2}{s_x^4}\\sum (x_i-\\bar x)^2f_{ij}- 2\\frac{s_{xy}}{s_x^2}\\sum (x_i-\\bar x)(y_j -\\bar y)f_{ij}= \\newline \u0026amp; = s_y^2 + \\frac{s_{xy}^2}{s_x^4}s_x^2 - 2 \\frac{s_{xy}}{s_x^2}s_{xy} = s_y^2 - \\frac{s_{xy}^2}{s_x^2}. \\end{aligned} $$\nand the coefficient of determination is\n$$ \\begin{aligned} r^2 \u0026amp;= 1- \\frac{s_{ry}^2}{s_y^2} = 1- \\frac{s_y^2 - \\frac{s_{xy}^2}{s_x^2}}{s_y^2} = 1 - 1 + \\frac{s_{xy}^2}{s_x^2s_y^2} = \\frac{s_{xy}^2}{s_x^2s_y^2}. \\end{aligned} $$\n   Example. In the sample of heights and weights, we had\n$$ \\begin{array}{lll} \\bar x = 174.67 \\mbox{ cm} \u0026amp; \\quad \u0026amp; s^2_x = 102.06 \\mbox{ cm}^2 \\newline \\bar y = 69.67 \\mbox{ Kg} \u0026amp; \u0026amp; s^2_y = 164.42 \\mbox{ Kg}^2 \\newline s_{xy} = 104.07 \\mbox{ cm$\\cdot$ Kg} \\end{array} $$\nThus, the linear coefficient of determination is\n$$r^2 = \\frac{s_{xy}^2}{s_x^2s_y^2} = \\frac{(104.07 \\mbox{ cm\\cdot Kg})^2}{102.06 \\mbox{ cm}^2 \\cdot 164.42 \\mbox{ Kg}^2} = 0.65.$$\nThis means that the linear model of weight on height explains the 65% of the variation of weight, and the linear model of height on weight also explains 65% of the variation of height.\nCorrelation coefficient  Definition - Sample correlation coefficient $r$. Given a sample of a two-dimensional variable $(X,Y)$, the sample correlation coefficient is the square root of the linear coefficient of determination, with the sign of the covariance,$$r = \\dfrac{s_{xy}}{s_xs_y}.$$    As $r^2$ ranges from 0 to 1, $r$ ranges from -1 to 1,\n$$-1\\leq r\\leq 1.$$\n   The correlation coefficient measures not only the strength of the linear association but also its direction (increasing or decreasing):\n If $r=0$ then there is no linear relation. Si $r=1$ then there is a perfect increasing linear relation. Si $r=-1$ then there is a perfect decreasing linear relation.    Example. In the sample of heights and weights, we had\n$$\\begin{array}{lll} \\bar x = 174.67 \\mbox{ cm} \u0026amp; \\quad \u0026amp; s^2_x = 102.06 \\mbox{ cm}^2 \\newline \\bar y = 69.67 \\mbox{ Kg} \u0026amp; \u0026amp; s^2_y = 164.42 \\mbox{ Kg}^2 \\newline s_{xy} = 104.07 \\mbox{ cm$\\cdot$ Kg} \\end{array} $$\nThus, the correlation coefficient is\n$$r = \\frac{s_{xy}}{s_xs_y} = \\frac{104.07 \\mbox{ cm\\cdot Kg}}{10.1 \\mbox{ cm} \\cdot 12.82 \\mbox{ Kg}} = +0.8.$$\nThis means that there is a rather strong linear, increasing, relation between height and weight.\nDifferent linear correlations The scatter plots below show linear regression models with differents correlations.\nReliability of regression predictions The coefficient of determination explains the goodness of fit of a regression model, but there are other factors that influence the reliability of regression predictions:\n  The coefficient of determination: The greater $r^2$, the greater the goodness of fit and the more reliable the predictions are.\n  The variability of the population distribution: The greater the variation, the more difficult to predict and the less reliable the predictions are.\n  The sample size: The greater the sample size, the more information we have and the more reliable the predictions are.\n   In addition, we have to take into account that a regression model is only valid for the range of values observed in the sample. That means that, as we donât have any information outside that range, we must not do predictions for values far from that range.   Non-linear regression The fit of a non-linear regression can be also done by the least square fitting method.\nHowever, in some cases the fitting of a non-linear model can be reduced to the fitting of a linear model applying a simple transformation to the variables of the model.\nTransformations of non-linear regression models   Logarithmic: A logarithmic model $y = a+b \\log x$ can be transformed in a linear model with the change $t=\\log x$:\n$$y=a+b\\log x = a+bt.$$\n  Exponential: An exponential model $y = e^{a+bx}$ can be transformed in a linear model with the change $z = \\log y$:\n$$z = \\log y = \\log(e^{a+bx}) = a+bx.$$\n  Potential: A potential model $y = ax^b$ can be transformed in a linear model with the changes $t=\\log x$ and $z=\\log y$:\n$$z = \\log y = \\log(ax^b) = \\log a + b \\log x = a^\\prime+bt.$$\n  Inverse: An inverse model $y = a+b/x$ can be transformed in a linear model with the change $t=1/x$:\n$$y = a + b(1/x) = a+bt.$$\n  Sigmoidal: A sigmoidal model $y = e^{a+b/x}$ can be transformed in a linear model with the changes $t=1/x$ and $z=\\log y$:\n$$z = \\log y = \\log (e^{a+b/x}) = a+b(1/x) = a+bt.$$\n  Exponential relation Example. The number of bacteria in a culture evolves with time according to the table below.\n$$\\begin{array}{c|c} \\mbox{Hours} \u0026amp; \\mbox{Bacteria} \\newline \\hline 0 \u0026amp; 25 \\newline 1 \u0026amp; 28 \\newline 2 \u0026amp; 47 \\newline 3 \u0026amp; 65 \\newline 4 \u0026amp; 86 \\newline 5 \u0026amp; 121 \\newline 6 \u0026amp; 190 \\newline 7 \u0026amp; 290 \\newline 8 \u0026amp; 362 \\end{array} $$\nThe scatter plot of the sample is showed below.\nFitting a linear model we get\n$$\\mbox{Bacteria} = -30.18+41,27,\\mbox{Hours, with } r^2=0.85.$$\nIs a good model?\nAlthough the linear model is not bad, according to the shape of the point cloud of the scatter plot, an exponential model looks more suitable.\nTo construct an exponential model $y = e^{a+bx}$ we can apply the transformation $z=\\log y$, that is, applying a logarithmic transformation to the dependent variable.\n$$\\begin{array}{c|c|c} \\mbox{Hours} \u0026amp; \\mbox{Bacteria} \u0026amp; \\mbox{$\\log$(Bacteria)} \\newline \\hline 0 \u0026amp; 25 \u0026amp; 3.22 \\newline 1 \u0026amp; 28 \u0026amp; 3.33 \\newline 2 \u0026amp; 47 \u0026amp; 3.85 \\newline 3 \u0026amp; 65 \u0026amp; 4.17 \\newline 4 \u0026amp; 86 \u0026amp; 4.45 \\newline 5 \u0026amp; 121 \u0026amp; 4.80 \\newline 6 \u0026amp; 190 \u0026amp; 5.25 \\newline 7 \u0026amp; 290 \u0026amp; 5.67 \\newline 8 \u0026amp; 362 \u0026amp; 5.89 \\end{array} $$\nNow it only remains to compute the regression line of the logarithm of bacteria on hours,\n$$\\mbox{$\\log$(Bacteria)} = 3.107 + 0.352, \\mbox{Horas},$$\nand, undoing the change of variable,\n$$\\mbox{Bacteria} = e^{3.107+0.352,\\mbox{Hours}}, \\mbox{ with } r^2=0.99.$$\nThus, the exponential model fits much better than the linear model.\n It is important to note that every regression model has its own coefficient of determination. Thus, a coefficient of determination near zero means that there is no relation as set by the model, but that does not mean that the variables are independent, because there could be a different type of relation.    Outliers in regression Outliers in regression studies are points that clearly do not follow the tendency of the rest of points, even if the values of the pair are not outliers for every variable separately.\nOutliers influence in regression Outliers in regression studies can provoke drastic changes in the regression models.\n ","date":1461110400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1600206500,"objectID":"a459deb83268bdce67f7ac69652daa44","permalink":"/en/teaching/statistics/manual/regression/","publishdate":"2016-04-20T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/en/teaching/statistics/manual/regression/","section":"teaching","summary":"In the last chapter we saw how to describe the distribution of a single variable in a sample.

For that reason, to guarantee the representativeness of the sample, this must be drawn randomly. This means that the choice of individuals in the sample is by chance.\nProbability Theory will provide us the tools to control the random in the sampling and to determine the level of reliability of the conclusions drawn from the sample.\nRandom experiments and events Random experiments The study of a characteristic of the population is conducted through random experiments.\n Definition - Random experiment. A random experiment is an experiment that meets two conditions:\n The set of possible outcomes is known. It is impossible to predict the outcome with absolute certainty.    Example. Gambling are typical examples of random experiments. The roll of a dice, for example, is a random experiment because\n It is known the set of possible outcomes: $\\{1,2,3,4,5,6\\}$. Before rolling the dice, it is impossible to predict with absolute certainty the outcome.  Another non-gambling example is the random choice of an individual of a human population and the determination of its blood type.\nGenerally, the draw of a sample by a random method is an random experiment.\nSample space  Definition - Sample space. The set $\\Omega$ of the possible outcomes of a random experiment is known as the sample space.   Example. Some examples of sample spaces are:\n For the toss of a coin $\\Omega=\\{\\mbox{heads},\\mbox{tails}\\}$. For the roll of a dice $\\Omega=\\{1,2,3,4,5,6\\}$. For the blood type of an individual drawn by chance $\\Omega=\\{\\mbox{A},\\mbox{B},\\mbox{AB},\\mbox{0}\\}$. For the height of an individual drawn by chance $\\Omega=\\mathbb{R}^+$.  Tree diagrams In experiments where more than one variable is measured, the determination of the sample space can be difficult. In such a cases, it is advisable to use a tree diagram to construct the sample space.\nIn a tree diagram every variable is represented in a level of the tree and every possible outcome of the variable as a branch.\nExample. The tree diagram below represents the sample space of a random experiment where the gender and the blood type is measured in a random individual.\nRandom events  Definition - Random event. A random event is any subset of the sample space $\\Omega$ of a random experiment.   There are different types of events:\n Impossible event: Is the event with no elements $\\emptyset$. It has no chance of occurring. Elemental events: Are events with only one element, that is, a singleton. Composed events: Are events with two or more elements. Sure event: Is the event that contains the whole sample space $\\Omega$. It always happens.  Set theory Event space  Definition - Event space. Given a sample space $\\Omega$ of a random experiment, the event space of $\\Omega$ is the set of all possible events of $\\Omega$, and is noted $\\mathcal{P}(\\Omega).$   Example. Given the sample space $\\Omega=\\{a,b,c\\}$, its even space is\n$$\\mathcal{P}(\\Omega)=\\{\\emptyset, {a},{b},{c},{a,b},{a,c},{b,c},{a,b,c}\\}$$\nAs events are subsets of the sample space, using the set theory we have the following operations on events:\n Union Intersection Complement Difference  Union of events  Definition - Union event. Given two events $A,B\\subseteq \\Omega$, the union of $A$ and $B$, denoted by $A\\cup B$, is the event of all elements that are members of $A$ or $B$ or both.\n$$A\\cup B = \\{x\\,|\\, x\\in A\\textrm{ or }x\\in B\\}.$$\n  The union event $A\\cup B$ happens when $A$ or $B$ happen.\nIntersection of events  Definition - Intersection event. Given two events $A,B\\subseteq \\Omega$, the intersection of $A$ and $B$, denoted by $A\\cap B$, is the event of all elements that are members of both $A$ and $B$.\n$$A\\cap B = \\{x\\,|\\, x\\in A\\textrm{ and }x\\in B\\}.$$\n  The intersection event $A\\cap B$ happens when $A$ and $B$ happen.\nTwo events are incompatible if their intersection is empty.\nComplement of an event  Definition - Complementary event. Given an event $A\\subseteq \\Omega$, the complementary or contrary event of $A$, denoted by $\\bar A$, is the event of all elements of $\\Omega$ except the elements that are members of $A$.\n$$\\bar A = \\{x\\,|\\, x\\not\\in A\\}.$$\n  The complementary event $\\bar A$ happens when $A$ does not happen.\nDifference of events  Definition - Difference event. Given two events $A,B\\subseteq \\Omega$, the difference of $A$ and $B$, denoted by $A-B$, is the event of all elements that are members of $A$ but not are members of $B$.\n$$A-B = \\{x\\,|\\, x\\in A\\textrm{ and }x\\not\\in B\\} = A \\cap \\bar B.$$\n  The difference event $A-B$ happens when $A$ happens but $B$ does not.\nExample. Given the sample space of rolling a dice $\\Omega=\\{1,2,3,4,5,6\\}$ and the events $A=\\{2,4,6\\}$ and $B=\\{1,2,3,4\\}$,\n The union of $A$ and $B$ is $A\\cup B=\\{1,2,3,4,6\\}$. The intersection of $A$ and $B$ is $A\\cap B=\\{2,4\\}$. The complement of $A$ is $\\bar A=\\{1,3,5\\}$. The events $A$ and $\\bar A$ are incompatible. The difference of $A$ and $B$ is $A-B=\\{6\\}$, and the difference of $B$ and $A$ is $B-A=\\{1,3\\}$.  Algebra of events Given the events $A,B,C\\subseteq \\Omega$, the following properties are meet.\n $A\\cup A=A$, $\\quad A\\cap A=A$ (idempotency). $A\\cup B=B\\cup A$, $\\quad A\\cap B = B\\cap A$ (commutative). $(A\\cup B)\\cup C = A\\cup (B\\cup C)$, $\\quad (A\\cap B)\\cap C = A\\cap (B\\cap C)$ (associative). $(A\\cup B)\\cap C = (A\\cap C)\\cup (B\\cap C)$, $\\quad (A\\cap B)\\cup C = (A\\cup C)\\cap (B\\cup C)$ (distributive). $A\\cup \\emptyset=A$, $\\quad A\\cap \\Omega=A$ (neutral element). $A\\cup \\Omega=\\Omega$, $\\quad A\\cap \\emptyset=\\emptyset$ (absorbing element). $A\\cup \\overline A = \\Omega$, $\\quad A\\cap \\overline A= \\emptyset$ (complementary symmetric element). $\\overline{\\overline A} = A$ (double contrary). $\\overline{A\\cup B} = \\overline A\\cap \\overline B$, $\\quad \\overline{A\\cap B} = \\overline A\\cup \\overline B$ (Morganâs laws). $A\\cap B\\subseteq A\\cup B$.  Probability definition Classical definition of probability  Definition - Probability (Laplace). Given a sample space $\\Omega$ of a random experiment where all elements of $\\Omega$ are equally likely, the probability of an event $A\\subseteq \\Omega$ is the quotient between the number of elements of $A$ and the number of elements of $\\Omega$\n$$P(A) = \\frac{|A|}{|\\Omega|} = \\frac{\\mbox{number of favorable outcomes}}{\\mbox{number of possible outcomes}}$$\n  This definition is well known, but it has important restrictions:\n It is required that all the elements of the sample space are equally likely (equiprobability). It can not be used with infinite sample spaces.  Example. Given the sample space of rolling a dice $\\Omega=\\{1,2,3,4,5,6\\}$ and the event $A=\\{2,4,6\\}$, the probability of $A$ is\n$$P(A) = \\frac{|A|}{|\\Omega|} = \\frac{3}{6} = 0.5.$$\nHowever, given the sample space of the blood type of a random individual $\\Omega=\\{O,A,B,AB\\}$, it is not possible to use the classical definition to compute the probability of having group $A$,\n$$P(A) \\neq \\frac{|A|}{|\\Omega|} = \\frac{1}{4} = 0.25,$$\nbecause the blood types are not equally likely in human populations.\nFrequency definition of probability  Theorem - Law of large numbers. When a random experiment is repeated a large number of times, the relative frequency of an event tends to the probability of the event.   The following definition of probability uses this theorem.\n Definition - Frequency probability. Given a sample space $\\Omega$ of a replicable random experiment, the probability of an event $A\\subseteq \\Omega$ is the relative frequency of the event $A$ in an infinite number of repetitions of the experiment\n$$P(A) = lim_{n\\rightarrow \\infty}\\frac{n_A}{n}$$\n  Although frequency probability avoid the restrictions of classical definition, it also have some drawbacks:\n It computes an estimation of the real probability (more accurate the higher the sample size). The repetition of the experiment must be in identical conditions.  Example. Given the sample space of tossing a coin $\\Omega=\\{H,T\\}$, if after tossing the coin 100 times we got 54 heads, then the probability of $H$ is\n$$P(H) = \\frac{n_H}{n} = \\frac{54}{100} = 0.54.$$\nGiven the sample space of the blood type of a random individual $\\Omega=\\{O,A,B,AB\\}$, if after drawing a random sample of 1000 persons we got 412 with blood type $A$, then the probability of $A$ is\n$$P(A) = \\frac{n_A}{n} = \\frac{412}{1000} = 0.412.$$\nAxiomatic definition of probability  Definition - Probability (KolmogÃ³rov). Given a sample space $\\Omega$ of a random experiment, a probability function is a function that maps every event $A\\subseteq \\Omega$ a real number $P(A)$, known as the probability of $A$, that meets the following axioms:\n  The probability of any event is nonnegative,\n$$P(A)\\geq 0.$$\n  The probability of the sure event is 1,\n$$P(\\Omega)=1$$\n  The probability of the union of two incompatible events ($A\\cap B=\\emptyset$) is the sum of their probabilities\n$$P(A\\cup B) = P(A)+P(B).$$\n    From the previous axioms is possible to deduce some important properties of a probability function.\nGiven a sample space $\\Omega$ of a random experiment and the events $A,B\\subseteq \\Omega$, the following properties are meet:\n  $P(\\bar A) = 1-P(A)$.\n  $P(\\emptyset)= 0$.\n  If $A\\subseteq B$ then $P(A)\\leq P(B)$.\n  $P(A) \\leq 1$. This means that $P(A)\\in [0,1]$.\n  $P(A-B)=P(A)-P(A\\cap B)$.\n  $P(A\\cup B)= P(A) + P(B) - P(A\\cap B)$.\n  If $A=\\{e_1,\\ldots,e_n\\}$, where $e_i$ $i=1,\\ldots,n$ are elemental events, then\n$$P(A)=\\sum_{i=1}^n P(e_i).$$\n   Proof    $\\bar A = \\Omega \\Rightarrow P(A\\cup \\bar A) = P(\\Omega) \\Rightarrow P(A)+P(\\bar A) = 1 \\Rightarrow P(\\bar A)=1-P(A)$.\n  $\\emptyset = \\bar \\Omega \\Rightarrow P(\\emptyset) = P(\\bar \\Omega) = 1-P(\\Omega) = 1-1 = 0.$\n  $B = A\\cup (B-A)$. As $A$ and $B-A$ are incompatible, $P(B) = P(A\\cup (B-A)) = P(A)+P(B-A) \\geq P(A).$\nIf we think of probabilities as areas, it is easy to see graphically,\n  $A\\subseteq \\Omega \\Rightarrow P(A)\\leq P(\\Omega)=1.$\n  $A=(A-B)\\cup (A\\cap B)$. As $A-B$ and $A\\cap B$ are incompatible, $P(A)=P(A-B)+P(A\\cap B) \\Rightarrow P(A-B)=P(A)-P(A\\cap B)$.\nIf we think of probabilities as areas, it is easy to see graphically,\n  $A\\cup B= (A-B) \\cup (B-A) \\cup (A\\cap B)$. As $A-B$, $B-A$ and $A\\cap B$ are incompatible, $P(A\\cup B)=P(A-B)+P(B-A)+P(A\\cap B) =P(A)-P(A\\cap B)+P(B)-P(A\\cap B)+P(A\\cap B)$ $=P(A)+P(B)-P(A\\cup B)$.\nIf we think again of probabilities as areas, it is easy to see graphically because the area of $A\\cap B$ is added twice (one for $A$ and other for $), so it must be subtracted once.\n  $A=\\{e_1,\\cdots,e_n\\} = \\{e_1\\}\\cup \\cdots \\cup \\{e_n\\} \\Rightarrow P(A)=P(\\{e_1\\}\\cup \\cdots \\cup \\{e_n\\}) = P(\\{e_1\\})+ \\cdots P(\\{e_n\\}).$\n     Probability interpretation As set by the previous axioms, the probability of an event $A$, is a real number $P(A)$ that always ranges from 0 to 1.\nIn a certain way, this number expresses the plausibility of the event, that is, the chances that the event $A$ occurs in the experiment. Therefore, it also gives a measure of the uncertainty about the event.\n The maximum uncertainty correspond to probability $P(A)=0.5$ ($A$ and $\\bar A$ have the same chances of happening). The minimum uncertainty correspond to probability $P(A)=1$ ($A$ will happen with absolute certainty) and $P(A)=0$ ($A$ wonât happen with absolute certainty)  When $P(A)$ is closer to 0 than to 1, the chances of not happening $A$ are greater than the chances of happening $A$. On the contrary, when $P(A)$ is closer to 1 than to 0, the chances of happening $A$ are greater than the chances of not happening $A$.\nConditional probability Conditional experiments Occasionally, we can get some information about the experiment before its realization. Usually that information is given as an event $B$ of the same sample space that we know that is true before we conduct the experiment.\nIn such a case, we will say that $B$ is a conditioning event and the probability of another event $A$ is known as a conditional probability and expressed $P(A\\vert B)$. This must be read as probability of $A$ given $B$ or probability of $A$ under the condition $B$.\nUsually, conditioning events change the sample space and therefore the probabilities of events.\nExample. Assume that we have a sample of 100 women and 100 men with the following frequencies\n$$ \\begin{array}{|c|c|c|} \\hline \u0026amp; \\mbox{Non-smokers} \u0026amp; \\mbox{Smokers} \\newline \\hline \\mbox{Females} \u0026amp; 80 \u0026amp; 20 \\newline \\hline \\mbox{Males} \u0026amp; 60 \u0026amp; 40 \\newline \\hline \\end{array} $$\nThen, using the frequency definition of probability, the\n$$P(\\mbox{Smoker})= \\frac{60}{200}=0.3.$$\nHowever, if we know that the person is a woman, then the sample is reduced to the first row, and the probability of being smoker is\n$$P(\\mbox{Smoker}\\mid\\mbox{Female})=\\frac{20}{100}=0.2.$$\nConditional probability  Definition - Conditional probability Given a sample space $\\Omega$ of a random experiment, and two events $A,B\\subseteq \\Omega$, the probability of $A$ conditional on $B$ occurring is\n$$P(A|B) = \\frac{P(A\\cap B)}{P(B)},$$as long as, $P(B)\\neq 0$.\n  This definition allows to calculate conditional probabilities without changing the original sample space.\nExample. In the previous example\n$$P(\\mbox{Smoker}\\mid\\mbox{Female})= \\frac{P(\\mbox{Smoker}\\cap \\mbox{Female})}{P(\\mbox{Female})} = \\frac{20/200}{100/200}=\\frac{80}{100}=0.8.$$\nProbability of the intersection event From the definition of conditional probability it is possible to derive the formula for the probability of the intersection of two events.\n$$P(A\\cap B) = P(A)P(B|A) = P(B)P(A|B).$$\nExample. In a population there are a 30% of smokers and we know that there are a 40% of smokers with breast cancer. The probability of a random person being smoker and having breast cancer is\n$$P(\\mbox{Smoker}\\cap \\mbox{Cancer})= P(\\mbox{Smoker})P(\\mbox{Cancer}\\mid\\mbox{Smoker}) = 0.3\\times 0.4 = 0.12.$$\nIndependence of events Sometimes, the probability of the conditioning event does not change the original probability of the main event.\n Definition - Independent events. Given a sample space $\\Omega$ of a random experiment, two events $A,B\\subseteq \\Omega$ are independents if the probability of $A$ does not change when conditioning on $B$, and vice-versa, that is,\n$$P(A|B) = P(A) \\quad \\mbox{and} \\quad P(B|A)=P(B),$$\nif $P(A)\\neq 0$ and $P(B)\\neq 0$.\n  This means that the occurrence of one event does not give relevant information to change the uncertainty of the other.\nWhen two events are independent, the probability of the intersection of them is equal to the product of their probabilities,\n$$P(A\\cap B) = P(A)P(B).$$\nExample. The sample space of tossing twice a coin is $\\Omega=\\{(H,H),(H,T),(T,H),(T,T)\\}$ and all the elements are equiprobable if the coin is fair. Thus, applying the classical definition of probability we have\n$$P((H,H)) = \\frac{1}{4} = 0.25.$$\nIf we name $H_1={(H,H),(H,T)}$, that is, having heads in the first toss, and $H_2=\\{(H,H),(T,H)\\}$, that is, having heads in the second toss, we can get the same result assuming that these events are independent,\n$$P(H,H)= P(H_1\\cap H_2) = P(H_1)P(H_2) = \\frac{2}{4}\\frac{2}{4}=\\frac{1}{4}=0.25.$$\nProbability Space  Definition - Probability space. A probability space of a random experiment is a triplet $(\\Omega,\\mathcal{F},P)$ where\n $\\Omega$ is the sample space of the experiment. $\\mathcal{F}$ is a set of events of the experiment. $P$ is a probability function.    If we know the probabilities of all the elements of $\\Omega$, then we can calculate the probability of every event in $\\mathcal{F}$ and we can construct easily the probability space.\nProbability space construction In order to determine the probability of every elemental event we can use a tree diagram, using the following rules:\n For every node of the tree, label the incoming edge with the probability of the variable in that level having the value of the node, conditioned by events corresponding to its ancestor nodes in the tree. The probability of every elemental event in the leaves is the product of the probabilities on edges that go form the root to the leave.  Probability tree with dependent variables In a probability tree with dependent variables, the probababilities of every level of the tree are different depending on the outcome of the previous leves.\nExample. In a population there are a 30% of smokers and we know that there are a 40% of smokers with breast cancer, while only 10% of non-smokers have breast cancer. The probability tree of the probability space of the random experiment consisting of picking a random person and measuring the variables smoking and breast cancer is shown below.\nProbability tree with independent variables In a probability tree with independent variables, the probabilities of every level of the tree are the same no matter the outcome of the previous leves.\nExample. The probability tree of the random experiment of tossing two coins is shown below.\nExample. In a population there are 40% of males and 60% of females, the probability tree of drawing a random sample of three persons is shown below.\nTotal probability theorem Partition of the sample space  Definition - Partition of the sample space. A collection of events $A_1,A_2,\\ldots,A_n$ of the same sample space $\\Omega$ is a partition of the sample space if it satisfies the following conditions\n The union of the events is the sample space, that is, $A_1\\cup \\cdots\\cup A_n =\\Omega$. All the events are mutually incompatible, that is, $A_i\\cap A_j = \\emptyset$ $\\forall i\\neq j$.    Usually it is easy to get a partition of the sample space splitting a population according to some categorical variable, like for example gender, blood type, etc.\nTotal probability theorem If we have a partition of a sample space, we can use it to calculate the probabilities of other events in the same sample space.\n Theorem - Total probability. Given a partition $A_1,\\ldots,A_n$ of a sample space $\\Omega$, the probability of any other event $B$ of the same sample space can be calculated with the formula\n$$P(B) = \\sum_{i=1}^n P(A_i\\cap B) = \\sum_{i=1}^n P(A_i)P(B|A_i).$$\n   Proof  The proof of the theorem is quite simple. As $A_1,\\ldots,A_n$ is a partition of $\\Omega$, we have\n$$B = B\\cap \\Omega = B\\cap (A_1\\cup \\cdots \\cup A_n) = (B\\cap A_1)\\cup \\cdots \\cup (B\\cap A_n).$$\nAnd all the events of this union are mutually incompatible as $A_1,\\ldots,A_n$ are, thus\n$$ \\begin{aligned} P(B) \u0026amp;= P((B\\cap A_1)\\cup \\cdots \\cup (B\\cap A_n)) = P(B\\cap A_1)+\\cdots + P(B\\cap A_n) =\\newline \u0026amp;= P(A_1)P(B|A_1)+\\cdots + P(A_n)P(B|A_n) = \\sum_{i=1}^n P(A_i)P(B|A_i). \\end{aligned} $$\n   Example. A symptom $S$ can be caused by a disease $D$, but it can also be present in persons without the disease. In a population, the rate of people with the disease is $0.2$. We know also that $90%$ of persons with the disease have the symptom, while only $40%$ of persons without the disease have it.\nWhat is the probability that a random person of the population has the symptom?\nTo answer the question we can apply the total probability theorem using the partition $\\{A,\\bar A\\}$:\n$$P(S) = P(D)P(S|D)+P(\\bar D)P(S|\\bar D) = 0.2\\cdot 0.9 + 0.8\\cdot 0.4 = 0.5.$$\nThat is, half of the population has the symptom.\nIndeed, it is a weighted mean of probabilities!\nThe answer to the previous question is even clearer with the tree diagram of the probability space.\n$$ \\begin{aligned} P(S) \u0026amp;= P(D,S) + P(\\bar D,S) = P(D)P(S|D)+P(\\bar D)P(S|\\bar D)\\newline \u0026amp; = 0.2\\cdot 0.9+ 0.8\\cdot 0.4 = 0.18 + 0.32 = 0.5. \\end{aligned} $$\nBayes theorem A partition of a sample space $A_1,\\cdots,A_n$ may also be interpreted as a set of feasible hypothesis for a fact $B$.\nIn such cases it may be helpful to calculate the posterior probability $P(A_i\\vert B)$ of every hypothesis.\n Definition - Bayes. Given a partition $A_1,\\ldots,A_n$ of a sample space $\\Omega$ and another event $B$ of the same sample space, the conditional probability of every even $A_i$ $i=1,\\ldots,n$ on $B$ can be calculated with the following formula\n$$P(A_i|B) = \\frac{P(A_i\\cap B)}{P(B)} = \\frac{P(A_i)P(B|A_i)}{\\sum_{i=1}^n P(A_i)P(B|A_i)}.$$\n  Example. In the previous example, a more interesting question is about the diagnosis for a person with the symptom.\nIn this case we can interpret $D$ and $\\overline{D}$ as the two feasible hypothesis for the symptom $S$. The prior probabilities for them are $P(D)=0.2$ and $P(\\overline{D})=0.8$. That means that if we do not have information about the symptom, the diagnosis would be that the person does not have the disease.\nHowever, if after examining the person we observe the symptom, that information changes the uncertainty about the hypothesis, and we need calculate the posterior probabilities to diagnose, that is, $P(D\\vert S)$ and $P(\\overline{D}\\vert S)$.\nTo calculate the posterior probabilities we can use the Bayes theorem.\n$$ \\begin{aligned} P(D|S) \u0026amp;= \\frac{P(D)P(S|D)}{P(D)P(S|D)+P(\\overline{D})P(S|\\overline{D})} = \\frac{0.2\\cdot 0.9}{0.2\\cdot 0.9 + 0.8\\cdot 0.4} = \\frac{0.18}{0.5}=0.36,\\newline P(\\overline{D}|S) \u0026amp;= \\frac{P(\\overline{D})P(S|\\overline{D})}{P(D)P(S|D)+P(\\overline{D})P(S|\\overline{D})} = \\frac{0.8\\cdot 0.4}{0.2\\cdot 0.9 + 0.8\\cdot 0.4} = \\frac{0.32}{0.5}=0.64. \\end{aligned} $$\nAs we can see the probability of having the disease has increased. Nevertheless, the probability of not having the disease is still greater than the probability of having it, and for that reason, the diagnosis is not having the disease.\nIn this case it is said the the symptom $S$ is not decisive in order to diagnose the disease.\nEpidemiology One of the branches of Medicine that makes an intensive use of probability is , that study the distribution and causes of diseases in populations identifying risk factors for disease and targets for preventive healthcare.\nIn Epidemiology we are interested in how often appears an event or medical event $D$ (typically a disease like flu, a risk factor like smoking or a protection factor like a vaccine) that is measured as a nominal variable with two categories (occurrence or not of the event).\nThere are different measures related to the frequency of a medical event. The most important are:\n Prevalence Incidence Relative risk Odds ratio  Prevalence  Definition - Prevalence. The prevalence of a medical event $D$ is the proportion of a particular population that is affected by a medical event.\n$$\\mbox{Prevalence}(D) = \\frac{\\mbox{Num people affected by $D$}}{\\mbox{Population size}}$$\n  Often, the prevalence is estimated from a sample as the relative frequency of people affected by the event in the sample. It is also common to express that frequency as a percentage.\nExample. To estimate the prevalence of flu a sample of 1000 persons has been studied and 150 of them had flu. Thus, the prevalence of flu is approximately 150/1000=0.15, that is, a 15%.\nIncidence Incidence measures the probability of occurrence of a medical event in a population within a given period of time. Incidence can be measured as a cumulative proportion or as a rate.\n Definition - Cumulative incidence. The cumulative incidence of a medical event $D$ is the proportion of people that experience the event in a period of time, that is, the number of new cases with the event in the period of time divided by the size of the population at risk.\n$$R(D)=\\frac{\\mbox{Num of new cases with $D$}}{\\mbox{Population at risk size}}$$\n  Example. A population initially contains 1000 persons without flu and after two years of observation 160 of them got the flu. The incidence proportion of flu is 160 cases per 1000 persons per two years, i.e. 16% per two years.\nIncidence rate or Absolute risk  Definition - Incidence rate. The incidence rate or absolute risk of a medical event $D$ is the number of new cases with the event divided by the size of the population at risk and by the number of units of time in a given period.\n$$R(D)=\\frac{\\mbox{Num of new cases with $D$}}{\\mbox{Population at risk size}\\times \\mbox{Num of unit time intervals}}$$\n  Example. A population initially contains $1000$ persons without flu and after two years of observation 160 of them got the flu. If we consider the year as the unit of time, the incidence rate of flu is 160 cases per $1000$ persons divided by two years, i.e. 80 cases per 1000 persons-year or 8% persons per year.\nPrevalence vs Incidence Prevalence must not be confused with incidence. Prevalence indicates how widespread the medical event is, and is more a measure of the burden of the event on society with no regard to time at risk or when subjects may have been exposed to a possible risk factor, whereas incidence conveys information about the risk of being affected by the event.\nPrevalence can be measured in cross-sectional studies at a particular time, while in order to measure incidence we need a longitudinal study observing the individuals during a period of time.\nIncidence is usually more useful than prevalence in understanding the event etiology: for example, if the incidence of a disease in a population increases, then there is a risk factor that promotes it.\nWhen the incidence is approximately constant for the duration of the event, prevalence is approximately the product of event incidence and average event duration, so\n$$\\mbox{prevalence} = \\mbox{incidence} \\times \\mbox{duration}$$\nComparing risks In order to determine if a factor or characteristic is associated with the medical event we need to compare the risk of the medical event in two populations, one exposed to the factor and the other not exposed. The group of people exposed to the factor is known as the treatment group or experimental group and the group of people unexposed as the control group.\nUsually the cases observed for each group are represented in a 2$\\times$2 table like the one below.\n   Event $D$ No event $\\overline D$    Treatment group (exposed) $a$ $b$  Control group(unexposed) $c$ $d$    Attributable risk or Risk difference $RD$  Definition - Attributable risk. The attributable risk or risk difference of a medical event $D$ for people exposed to a factor is the difference between the absolute risks of the treatment group and the control group.\n$$\\begin{aligned}RD(D) \u0026amp;= \\mbox{Risk in treatment group}-\\mbox{Risk in control group}=\\newline \u0026amp;= R_T(D)-R_C(D)=\\frac{a}{a+b}-\\frac{c}{c+d}. \\end{aligned} $$\n  The attributable risk is the risk of an event that is specifically due to the factor of interest.\nObserve that the attributable risk can be positive, when the risk of the treatment group is greater than the risk of the control group, and negative, on the contrary.\nExample. To determine the effectiveness of a vaccine against the flu, a sample of 1000 person without flu was selected at the beginning of the year. Half of them were vaccinated (treatment group) and the other received a placebo (control group). The table below summarize the results at the end of the year.\n   Flu $D$ No flu $\\overline D$    Treatment group(vaccinated) 20 480  Control group(Unvaccinated) 80 420    The attributable risk of getting the flu for people vaccinated is\n$$AR(D) = \\frac{20}{20+480}-\\frac{80}{80+420} = -0.12.$$\nThis means that the risk of getting flu in vaccinated people is a 12% less than in unvaccinated.\nRelative risk $RR$  Definition - Relative risk. The relative risk of a medical event $D$ for people exposed to a factor is the quotient between the proportions of people that acquired the event in a period of time in the treatment and control groups. That is, the quotient between the incidences of the treatment and the control groups.\n$$RR(D)=\\frac{\\mbox{Risk in treatment group}}{\\mbox{Risk in control group}}=\\frac{R_1(D)}{R_0(D)}=\\frac{a/(a+b)}{c/(c+d)}$$\n  Relative risk compares the risk of a medical event between the treatment and the control groups.\n  $RR=1$ $\\Rightarrow$ There is no association between the event and the exposure to the factor. $RR\u0026lt;1$ $\\Rightarrow$ Exposure to the factor decreases the risk of the event. $RR\u0026gt;1$ $\\Rightarrow$ Exposure to the factor increases the risk of the event.  The further from 1, the stronger the association.   Example. To determine the effectiveness of a vaccine against the flu, a sample of 1000 person without flu was selected at the beginning of the year. Half of them were vaccinated (treatment group) and the other received a placebo (control group). The table below summarize the results at the end of the year.\n   Flu $D$ No flu $\\overline D$    Treatment group(vaccinated) 20 480  Control group(Unvaccinated) 80 420    The relative risk of getting the flu for people vaccinated is\n$$RR(D) = \\frac{20/(20+480)}{80/(80+420)} = 0.25.$$\nThis means that vaccinated people were only one-fourth as likely to develop flu as were unvaccinated people, i.e. the vaccine reduce the risk of flu by 75%.\nOdds An alternative way of measuring the risk of a medical event is the odds.\n Definition - Odds. The odds of a medical event $D$ in a population is the quotient between the people that acquired the event and people that not in a period of time.   Unlike incidence or absolute risk, that is a proportion less than 1, the odds can be greater than 1. However, it is possible to convert an odd into a probability with the formula\n$$P(D) = \\frac{\\mbox{ODDS}(D)}{\\mbox{ODDS}(D)+1}$$\nExample. A population initially contains $1000$ persons without flu and after a year 160 of them got the flu. The odds of flu is 160/840.\nObserve that the incidence is 160/1000.\nOdds ratio $OR$  Definition - Odds ratio. The odds ratio of a medical event $D$ for people exposed to a factor is the quotient between the odds of people that acquired the event in a period of time in the treatment and control groups.\n$$OR(D)=\\frac{\\mbox{Odds in treatment group}}{\\mbox{Odds in control group}}=\\frac{a/b}{c/d}=\\frac{ad}{bc}$$\n  Odds ratio compares the odds of a medical event between the treatment and the control groups. The interpretation is similar to the relative risk.\n  $OR=1$ $\\Rightarrow$ There is no association between the event and the exposure to the factor. $OR\u0026lt;1$ $\\Rightarrow$ Exposure to the factor decreases the risk of the event. $OR\u0026gt;1$ $\\Rightarrow$ Exposure to the factor increases the risk of the event.  The further from 1, the stronger the association.   Example. To determine the effectiveness of a vaccine against the flu, a sample of 1000 person without flu was selected at the beginning of the year. Half of them were vaccinated (treatment group) and the other received a placebo (control group). The table below summarize the results at the end of the year.\n   Flu $D$ No flu $\\overline D$    Treatment group(vaccinated) 20 480  Control group(Unvaccinated) 80 420    The odds ratio of getting the flu for people vaccinated is\n$$OR(D) = \\frac{20/480}{80/420} = 0.21875.$$\nThis means that the odds of getting the flu versus not getting the flu in vaccinated individuals is almost one fifth of that in unvaccinated, i.e. approximately for every 22 persons vaccinated with flu there will be 100 persons unvaccinated with flu.\nRelative risk vs Odds ratio Relative risk and odds ratio are two measures of association but their interpretation is slightly different. While the relative risk expresses a comparison of risks between the treatment and control groups, the odds ratio expresses a comparison of odds, that is not the same than the risk. Thus, an odds ratio of 2 does not mean that the treatment group has the double of risk of acquire the medical event.\nThe interpretation of the odds ratio is trickier because is counterfactual, and give us how many times is more frequent the event in the treatment group in comparison with the control group, assuming that in the control group the event is as frequent as the non-event.\nThe advantage of the odds ratio is that it does not depend on the prevalence or the incidence of the event, and must be used necessarily when the number of people with the medical event is selected arbitrarily in both groups, like in the case-control studies.\nExample. In order to determine the association between lung cancer and smoking two samples were selected (the second one with the double of non-cancer individuals) getting the following results:\nSample 1\n   Cancer No cancer    Smokers 60 80  Non-smokers 40 320    $$ \\begin{aligned} RR(D) \u0026amp;= \\frac{60/(60+80)}{40/(40+320)} = 3.86.\\newline OR(D) \u0026amp;= \\frac{60/80}{40/320} = 6. \\end{aligned} $$\nSample 2\n   Cancer No cancer    Smokers 60 160  Non-smokers 40 640    $$ \\begin{aligned} RR(D) \u0026amp;= \\frac{60/(60+160)}{40/(40+640)} = 4.64.\\newline OR(D) \u0026amp;= \\frac{60/160}{40/640} = 6. \\end{aligned} $$\nThus, when we change the incidence or the prevalence of the event (lung cancer) the relative risk changes, while the odds ratio not.\nThe relation between the relative risk and the odds ratio is given by the following formula\n$$RR = \\frac{OR}{1-R_0+R_0OR} = OR\\frac{1-R_1}{1-R_0},$$\nwhere $R_0$ and $R_1$ are the prevalence or the incidence in control and treatment groups respectively.\nThe odds ratio always overestimate the relative risk when it is greater than 1 and underestimate it when it is less than 1. However, with rare medical events (with very small prevalence or incidence) the relative risk and the odds ratio are almost the same.\nDiagnostic tests In Epidemiology it is common to use diagnostic test to diagnose diseases.\nIn general, diagnostic tests are not fully reliable and have some risk of misdiagnosis as it is represented in the table below.\n$$ \\begin{array}{|l|c|c|} \\hline \u0026amp; \\mbox{Presence of disease }D \u0026amp; \\mbox{Absence of disease }\\bar D\\newline \\hline \\mbox{Test outcome positive } + \u0026amp; \\color{green}{ \\mbox{True Positive } TP} \u0026amp; \\color{red}{\\mbox{False Positive } FP}\\newline \\hline \\mbox{Test outcome negative } - \u0026amp; \\color{red}{\\mbox{False Negative } FN} \u0026amp; \\color{green}{\\mbox{True Negative } TN}\\newline \\hline \\end{array} $$\nSensitivity and specificity of a diagnostic test The performance of a diagnostic test depends on the following two probabilities.\n Definition - Sensitivity. The sensitivity of a diagnostic test is the proportion of positive outcomes in persons with the disease$$P(+|D)=\\frac{TP}{TP+FN}$$    Definition - Specificity. The specificity of a diagnostic test is the proportion of negative outcomes in persons without the disease$$P(-|\\overline{D})=\\frac{TN}{TN+FP}$$   Sensitivity and specificity interpretation Usually, there is a trade-off between sensitivity and specificity.\nA test with high sensitivity will detect the disease in most sick persons, but it will produce also more false positives than a less sensitive test. This way, a positive outcome in a test with high sensitivity is not useful for confirming the disease, but a negative outcome is useful for ruling out the disease, since it rarely misdiagnoses those who have the disease.\nOn the other hand, a test with a high specificity will rule out the disease in most healthy persons, but it will produce also more false negatives than a less specific test. Thus, a negative outcome in a test with high specificity is not useful for ruling out the disease, but a positive is useful to confirm the disease, since it rarely give positive outcomes in healthy people.\nDeciding on a test with greater sensitivity or a test with greater specificity depends on the type of disease and the goal of the test. In general, we will use a sensitive test when:\n The disease is serious and it is important to dectect it. The disease is curable. The false positives do not provoke serious traumas.  An we will use a specific test when:\n The disease is important but difficult or impossible to cure. The false positives provoke serious traumas. The treatment of false positives can have dangerous consequences.  Predictive values of a diagnostic test But the most important aspect of a diagnostic test is its predictive power, that is measured with the following two posterior probabilities.\n Definition - Positive predictive value $PPV$. The positive predictive value of a diagnostic test is the proportion of persons with the disease to persons with a positive outcome$$P(D|+) = \\frac{TP}{TP+FP}$$    Definition - Negative predictive value $NPV$. The negative predictive value of a diagnostic test is the proportion of persons without the disease to persons with a negative outcome$$P(\\overline{D}|-) = \\frac{TN}{TN+FN}$$   Positive and negative predictive values allow to confirm or to rule out the disease, respectively, if they reach at least a threshold of $0.5$.\n$$ \\begin{array}{rcl} PPV\u0026gt;0.5 \u0026amp; \\Rightarrow \u0026amp; \\mbox{Disease diagnostic}\\newline NPV\u0026gt;0.5 \u0026amp; \\Rightarrow \u0026amp; \\mbox{Not disease diagnostic} \\end{array} $$\nHowever, these probabilities depends on the proportion of persons with the disease in the population $P(D)$ that is known as of the disease. They can be calculated from the sensitivity and the specificity of the diagnostic test using the Bayes theorem.\n$$ \\begin{aligned} PPV=P(D|+) \u0026amp;= \\frac{P(D)P(+|D)}{P(D)P(+|D)+P(\\overline{D})P(+|\\overline{D})}\\newline NPV=P(\\overline{D}|-) \u0026amp;= \\frac{P(\\overline{D})P(-|\\overline{D})}{P(D)P(-|D)+P(\\overline{D})P(-|\\overline{D})} \\end{aligned} $$\nThus, with frequent diseases, the positive predictive value increases, and with rare diseases, the negative predictive value increases.\nExample. A diagnostic test for the flu has been tried in a random sample of 1000 persons. The results are summarized in the table below.\n$$ \\begin{array}{|l|c|c|} \\hline \u0026amp; \\mbox{Presence of flu } D \u0026amp; \\mbox{Absence of flu } \\bar D\\newline \\hline \\mbox{Test outcome } + \u0026amp; 95 \u0026amp; 90 \\newline \\hline \\mbox{Test outcome }- \u0026amp; 5 \u0026amp; 810 \\newline \\hline \\end{array} $$\nAccording to this sample, the prevalence of the flu can be estimated as\n$$P(D) = \\frac{95+5}{1000} = 0.1.$$\nThe sensitivity of this diagnostic test is\n$$P(+|D) = \\frac{95}{95+5}= 0.95.$$\nAnd the specificity is\n$$P(-|\\overline{D}) = \\frac{810}{90+810}=0.9.$$\nThe predictive positive value of the diagnostic test is\n$$PPV = P(D|+) = \\frac{95}{95+90} = 0.5135.$$\nAs this value is over $0.5$, this means that we will diagnose the flu if the outcome of the test is positive. However, the confidence in the diagnostic will be low, as this value is pretty close to $0.5$.\nOn the other hand, the predictive negative value is\n$$NPV = P(\\overline{D}|-) = \\frac{810}{5+810} = 0.9939.$$\nAs this value is almost 1, that means that is almost sure that a person does not have the flu if he or she gets a negative outcome in the test.\nThus, this test is a powerful test to rule out the flu, but not so powerful to confirm it.\nLikelihood ratios of a diagnostic test The following measures are usually derived from sensitivity and specificity.\n Definition - Positive likelihood ratio $LR+$. The positive likelihood ratio of a diagnostic test is the ratio between the probability of positive outcomes in persons with the disease and healthy persons respectively,\n$$LR+=\\frac{P(+|D)}{P(+|\\overline{D})} = \\frac{\\mbox{Sensitivity}}{1-\\mbox{Specificity}}$$\n   Definition - Negative likelihood ratio $LR-$. The negative likelihood ratio of a diagnostic test is the ratio between the probability of negative outcomes in persons with the disease and healthy persons respectively, $$LR-=\\frac{P(-|D)}{P(-|\\overline{D})} = \\frac{1-\\mbox{Sensitivity}}{\\mbox{Specificity}}$$   Positive likelihood ratio can be interpreted as the number of times that a positive outcome is more probable in people with the disease than in people without it.\nOn the other hand, negative likelihood ratio can be interpreted as the number of times that a negative outcome is more probable in people with the disease than in people without it.\nPost-test probabilities can be calculated from pre-test probabilities through likelihood ratios.\n$$P(D|+) = \\frac{P(D)P(+|D)}{P(D)P(+|D)+P(\\overline{D})P(+|\\overline{D})} = \\frac{P(D)LR+}{1-P(D)+P(D)LR+}$$\nThus,\n A likelihood ratio greater than 1 increases the probability of disease. A likelihood ratio less than 1 decreases the probability of disease. A likelihood ratio 1 does not change the pre-test probability.

In this section we will see how to use them.\nEnter formulas To enter a formula in a cell always start typing an equal sign = and then the formula expression.\nFormula expressions can contain arithmetic operators: addition +, subtraction -, multiplication *, division / and powers ^ and named predefined functions like SUM, EXP, SIN, etc. This allow to use Excel as a calculator. When Excel evaluates expressions first evaluate named functions, then powers, then products and quotients, and finally additions and subtractions, but it\u0026rsquo;s possible to use parenthesis to force the evaluation of a subexpression before.\nExample Assuming that cells A1, B1 and C1 contain the values 6,3 and 2 respectively, the next table shows some formulas and their respective results.\n   Formula Result     A1+B1-C1 7   A1+B1*C1 12   (A1+B1)*C1 18   A1/B1-C1 0   A1/(B1-C1) 6   A1+B1^C1 15   (A1+B1)^C1 81     Example. The animation below shows how to enter the formula 4+2 in cell A1, the formula 4-2 in cell B1, the formula 4*2 in cell C1, the formula 4/2 in cell D1, the formula 4^2 in cell E1 and the formula ((4+1)*2)^3 in cell F1.\nUsing relative and absolutes cell references in formulas Formula expressions can content references to cells. When Excel evaluates formulas it replace every cell reference by its content before doing the calculation.\nExample. The animation below shows how to use the formula =A1+B1 to add up the content of cells A1 and B1 in cell C1.\nReferences that are formed by the name of the cell or range are known as relative references, because referenced cells change When you copy a cell with a formula and paste in another cell. In general, when you copy a formula $n$ columns to the right and $m$ rows down, the referenced cells in the formulas will be updated by the cells $n$ columns to the right and $m$ rows down, an the same if you copy the cell to the left or top.\nExample. The animation below shows how to copy the formula =A1+B1 in cell C1, with relative references to A1 and B1, to the cell E4, that is 2 columns to the right and 3 rows down. Observe how the formula in cell E4 is updated to =C4+D4.\nA common way of copying the formula of a cell to adjacent cells is clicking the bottom-right corner of the cell and dragging the cursor to the desired range of cells.\nExample. The animation below shows how to generate the first ten numbers of the Fibonacci sequence. Cells A1 and B1 contains the two first numbers of the serie and cell C1 the formula =A1+B1 that add the two first numbers up and gives the third number of the serie. For generating the rest of the serie it is enough to copy the formula of cell C1 to the range D1:J1. Observe how references in formulas of these cells are updated.\nAlthough relative references are very helpful in many cases, sometimes we need the references in a formula to remain fixed when copied elsewhere.\nIn that case we need to use absolute references, that are like relative references but preceding the column name or the row name with a $ sign to fix either the row, the column or both on any cell reference.\nExample. The animation below shows how to calculate the IVA of a list of prices. Cells A2 to A5 contains the prices and cell F1 contains the IVA percentage. For calculating the IVA of first price we use the formula A2*F$4/100 where we fix the row of cell F4 because we wan it remain fixed when copying the formula down. Observe how the reference to cell F4 doesn\u0026rsquo;t change when copying the formula down.\nExample. The animation below shows how to calculate the multiplication table using absolute references.\nIn general, if you want to fix a reference in a formula that you pretend to copy horizontally, you must precede the column name with a $ sign; and if you pretend to copy the formula vertically, you must precede the row name with a $ sign.\nNaming cells and ranges Cell references are somewhat abstract, and don\u0026rsquo;t really communicate anything about the data they contain. This makes formulas that involve multiple references difficult to understand. To overcome this difficulty Excel allows to give name to cells or ranges. To define a cell or range name, select or cell range and click the Define Name button of the Defined Names panel in the ribbon\u0026rsquo;s Formulas tab. In the dialog that appears give a name to the cell and click OK. Cell or range names must begin with a letter and can\u0026rsquo;t include spaces.\nYou can also set the name of a cell or range in the name box of the input bar.\nAfter that you can use that cell o range name in any formula. Observe that references with names are always absolutes.\nExample. The animation below shows how to calculate the IVA of a list of prices using a cell name for the cell that contains the IVA percentage.\nFunctions Excel has a huge library of predefined functions that performs different calculations organised by categories. There are three ways to to enter a function in a formula expression:\n Type it rawly if you know its name and syntax. Select it from the buttons of the Functions Library panel in the ribbon\u0026rsquo;s Formulas tab.   Click the Insert Function button from the input bar. This will show you a dialog where you can type some key words for looking the desired function an select it. This dialog also shows help about the function and its syntax.  Numeric functions Numeric functions work with numbers or cells that contains numbers. They are the most frequently used.\nSUM function The most common function is SUM that calculates the sum of several numbers. Its syntax is SUM(number1,number2,...) where number1, number2, etc. are the numbers or cell ranges that you want to sum.\nExample The animation below shows how to calculate the sum of the subject grades for every student in a course.\nSUMIF function The SUMIF function its similar to the SUM function but only sum numbers that satisfied a given criterion. Its syntax is SUMIF(range,criterion,sum-range) range is the cell range to check the criterion, criterion is the condition expression of the criterion, sum-range is the range with the values to sum (if this argument is not provided, the sum is calculated over the values of the range argument that meet the criterion).\nThe expression with the condition can be a number, a cell reference, a logical expression starting with a logical operator (=,\u0026gt;,\u0026lt;,\u0026gt;=,\u0026lt;=,\u0026lt;\u0026gt;) in double quotes, or a pattern text with wildcards like the question mark ? (that matches any character) or the asterisk * (that matches any character string) in double quotes.\nExample The animation below shows how to calculate the sum of the grades greater than or equal to 5 for every student in a course.\nCOUNT function The COUNT function counts the number of cells with numbers in a range. Its syntax is COUNT(value1,value2,...) where value1, value2, etc. are the values or cell ranges to count.\nExample The animation below shows how to calculate the number of subjects grades for every student in a course.\nCOUNTIF function The COUNTIF function its similar to the COUNT but only counts number of cells that satisfied a given criterion. Its syntax is SUMIF(range,criterion) range is the cell range to check the criterion and criterion is the condition expression of the criterion,.\nThe expression with the condition can be a number, a cell reference, a logical expression starting with a logical operator (=,\u0026gt;,\u0026lt;,\u0026gt;=,\u0026lt;=,\u0026lt;\u0026gt;) in double quotes, or a pattern text with wildcards like the question mark ? (that matches any character) or the asterisk * (that matches any character string) in double quotes.\nExample The animation below shows how to calculate the number of passed subjects (grade greater than or equal to 5).\nMIN function The MIN function calculates the minimum value of several numbers. Its syntax is MIN(number1,number2,...) where number1, number2, etc. are numbers or cell ranges for which you want the minimum.\nExample The animation below shows how to calculate the minimum grade for every student in a course.\nMAX function The MAX function calculates the maximum value of several numbers. Its syntax is MAX(number1,number2,...) where number1, number2, etc. are numbers or cell ranges for which you want the maximum.\nExample The animation below shows how to calculate the maximum grade for every student in a course.\nISNUMBER function The ISNUMBER function checks if a value is number or not and returns the logical value TRUE in the first case and FALSE in the second. Its syntax is ISNUMBER(value) where value is a value or a cell reference.\nExample The animation below shows how to check if the cells of a range contain numbers or not. Observe that in the example cells with numbers are aligned to the right and that dates are numbers.\nLogical functions Logical functions are very useful to take decisions.\nIF function The most important logical function is the IF function, that checks whether a condition is met and returns a value if is true or another value if is false. Its syntax is IF(condition,true_value,false_value), where condition is the logical condition to test, true_value is the returned value if the condition is true, and false_value is the returned value if the condition is false.\nIn the logical condition expression you use logical operators like equal =, not equal \u0026lt;\u0026gt;, greater \u0026gt;, less \u0026lt;, greater than or equal to \u0026gt;=, less than or equal to \u0026lt;=, etc. In the true or false value you can put numbers, text in double quotes, dates, cell references or other formulas.\nExample The animation below shows how to use the IF function to decide if students pass or don\u0026rsquo;t pass a course depending on whether the average grade is greater than or equal to 5.\nAND function The AND function will return TRUE if all its arguments are true and FALSE if at least one argument is false. Its syntax is AND(contidion1,condition2,...), where condition1, condition2, etc are logical conditions.\nThe following table, known as a truth table, shows the returned value by the AND function according to the corresponding values of its arguments.\n   A B AND(A,B)     TRUE TRUE TRUE   TRUE FALSE FALSE   FALSE TRUE FALSE   FALSE FALSE FALSE    Â Example. The animation below shows how to use the AND function to see which students have passed all the subjects of a course with a grade greater than or equal to 5. Observe that conditions that involve blank cells are always false.\nOR function The OR function will return TRUE if one or more of its arguments are true and FALSE if all its arguments are false. Its syntax is OR(contidion1,condition2,...), where condition1, condition2, etc are logical conditions.\nThe following truth table shows the returned value by the OR function according to the corresponding values of its arguments.\n   A B OR(A,B)     TRUE TRUE TRUE   TRUE FALSE TRUE   FALSE TRUE TRUE   FALSE FALSE FALSE    Â Example. The animation below shows how to use the OR function to see which students have not passed some subjects of a course with a grade greater than or equal to 5.\nNOT function The NOT function will return TRUE if its argument is FALSE, and FALSE if its argument is TRUE. Its syntax is NOT(condition), where condition is a logical condition.\nThe following truth table shows the returned value by the NOT function according to the corresponding values of its argument.\n   A NOT(A)     TRUE FALSE   FALSE TRUE    Â Date and time functions Date and time functions performs operations with dates and times respectively.\nExcel convert automatically any entry with with a date or time formats into a serial number. For dates, this serial number represents the number of days that have elapsed since the beginning of the twentieth century (so that January 1, 1900, is serial number 1; January 2, 1900, is serial number 2; and so on). For times, this serial number is a fraction that represents the number of hours, minutes, and seconds that have elapsed since midnight (so that 00:00:00 is serial number 0.00000000, 12:00:00 p.m. (noon) is serial number 0.50000000; 11:00:00 p.m. is 0.95833333; and so on).\nTime elapsed between two dates or times. To calculate the time elapsed between two dates or times, just enter a formula that subtracts the earlier date or time from the later date or time. In the case of dates, Excel will return the number of days between these dates. If you want to express it in year units, just divide the number of days by 365.25. In the case of times, Excel will return the number of hours between these times. If you want to express it in days unit, just change the cell format to General.\nExample. The animation below shows how to calculate the time elapsed between two dates and two times.\nTODAY function The function TODAY returns the system date (usually the current date). Its syntax is TODAY() and this functions doesn\u0026rsquo;t have arguments.\nExample. The animation below shows how to calculate current age of a person using the TODAY function.\nDATE function The function DATE returns a date serial number for the date specified by the year, month, and day argument. Its syntax is DATE(year,month,day), where year is the year, month is the month (in number) and day is the day.\nExample. The animation below shows how to calculate the date given the year, moth and day.\nDAY, WEEKDAY, MONTH and YEAR functions The DAY function returns the day of the month of a date. Its' syntax is DAY(date), where date is the serial number of the date.\nThe WEEKDAY function returns the day of the week of a date. Its' syntax is WEEKDAY(date,type), where date is the serial number of the date and type has three possible values (1: 1 equals Sunday and 7 Saturday, 2: 1 equals Monday and 7 equals Sunday; 3: 0 equals Monday and 6 equals Sunday).\nThe MONTH function returns the number of the month of a date.

A random variable $X$ is a function that maps every element of the sample space of a random experiment to a real number.\n$$X:\\Omega \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$$\nThe set of values that the variable can assume is called the range and is represented by $\\mbox{Ran}(X)$.\n  In essence, a random variable is a variable whose values come from a random experiment, and every value has a probability of occurrence.\nExample. The variable $X$ that measures the outcome of rolling a dice is a random variable and its range is $\\mbox{Ran}(X)={1,2,3,4,5,6}$.\nTypes of random variables There are two types of random variables:\n  Discrete. They take isolated values, and their range is numerable. Example. Number of children of a family, number of smoked cigarettes, number of subjects passed, etc.\n  Continuous. They can take any value in a real interval, and their range is non-numerable. Example. Weight, height, age, cholesterol level, etc.\n  The way of modelling each type of variable is different. In this chapter we are going to study how to model discrete variables.\nProbability distribution of a discrete random variable As values of a discrete random variable are linked to the elementary events of a random experiment, every value has a probability.\n Definition - Probability function. The probability function of a discrete random variable $X$ is the function $f(x)$ that maps every value $x_i$ of the variable to its probability$$f(x_i) = P(X=x_i).$$   We can also accumulate probabilities the same way that we accumulated sample frequencies.\n Definition - Distribution function. The distribution function of a discrete random variable $X$ is the function $F(x)$ that maps every value $x_i$ of the variable to the probability of having a value less than or equal to $x_i$$$F(x_i) = P(X\\leq x_i) = f(x_1)+\\cdots +f(x_i).$$   The range of a discrete random variable and its probability function is known as probability distribution of the variable, and it is usually presented in a table\n$$ \\begin{array}{|c|cccc|c|} \\hline X \u0026amp; x_1 \u0026amp; x_2 \u0026amp; \\cdots \u0026amp; x_n \u0026amp; \\sum\\newline \\hline f(x) \u0026amp; f(x_1) \u0026amp; f(x_2) \u0026amp; \\cdots \u0026amp; f(x_n) \u0026amp; 1\\newline \\hline F(x) \u0026amp; F(x_1) \u0026amp; F(x_2) \u0026amp; \\cdots \u0026amp; F(x_n) =1 \u0026amp; \\newline \\hline \\end{array} $$\nThe same way that the sample frequency table shows the distribution of values of a variable in the sample, the probability distribution of a discrete random variable shows the distribution of values in the whole population.\nExample. Let $X$ be the discrete random variable that measures the number of heads after tossing two coins. The probability tree of the random experiment is\nAccording to this, the probability distribution of $X$ is\n$$\\begin{array}{|c|ccc|} \\hline X \u0026amp; 0 \u0026amp; 1 \u0026amp; 2\\newline \\hline f(x) \u0026amp; 0.25 \u0026amp; 0.5 \u0026amp; 0.25\\newline \\hline F(x) \u0026amp; 0.25 \u0026amp; 0.75 \u0026amp; 1 \\newline \\hline \\end{array} \\qquad F(x) = \\begin{cases} 0 \u0026amp; \\mbox{si $x\u0026lt;0$}\\newline 0.25 \u0026amp; \\mbox{si $0\\leq x\u0026lt; 1$}\\newline 0.75 \u0026amp; \\mbox{si $1\\leq x\u0026lt; 2$}\\newline 1 \u0026amp; \\mbox{si $x\\geq 2$} \\end{cases} $$\nPopulation statistics The same way we use sample statistics to describe the sample frequency distribution of a variable, we use population statistics to describe the probability distribution of a random variable in the whole population.\nThe population statistics definition is analogous to the sample statistics definition, but using probabilities instead of relative frequencies.\nThe most important are 1:\n Definition - Discrete random variable mean The mean or the expectec value of a discrete random variable $X$ is the sum of the products of its values and its probabilities:\n$$\\mu = E(X) = \\sum_{i=1}^n x_i f(x_i)$$\n   Definition - Discrete random variable variance and standard deviation The variance of a discrete random variable $X$ is the sum of the products of its squared values and its probabilities, minus the squared mean:\n$$\\sigma^2 = Var(X) = \\sum_{i=1}^n x_i^2 f(x_i) -\\mu^2$$\nThe standard deviation of a random variable $X$ is the square root of the variance:\n$$\\sigma = +\\sqrt{\\sigma^2}$$\n  Example. In the random experiment of tossing two coins the probability distribution is\n$$ \\begin{array}{|c|ccc|} \\hline X \u0026amp; 0 \u0026amp; 1 \u0026amp; 2\\newline \\hline f(x) \u0026amp; 0.25 \u0026amp; 0.5 \u0026amp; 0.25\\newline \\hline F(x) \u0026amp; 0.25 \u0026amp; 0.75 \u0026amp; 1 \\newline \\hline \\end{array} $$\nThe main population statistics are\n$$ \\begin{aligned} \\mu \u0026amp;= \\sum_{i=1}^n x_i f(x_i) = 0\\cdot 0.25 + 1\\cdot 0.5 + 2\\cdot 0.25 = 1 \\mbox{ heads},\\newline \\sigma^2 \u0026amp;= \\sum_{i=1}^n x_i^2 f(x_i) -\\mu^2 = (0^0\\cdot 0.25 + 1^2\\cdot 0.5 + 2^2\\cdot 0.25) - 1^2 = 0.5 \\mbox{ heads}^2,\\newline \\sigma \u0026amp;= +\\sqrt{0.5} = 0.71 \\mbox{ heads}. \\end{aligned} $$\nDiscrete probability distribution models According to the type of experiment where the random variable is measured, there are different probability distributions models. The most common are\n Discrete uniform Binomial Poisson  Discrete uniform distribution $U(a,b)$ When all the values of a random variable $X$ have equal probability, the probability distribution of $X$ is uniform.\n Definition - Discrete uniform distribution $U(a,b)$. A discrete random variable $X$ follows a discrete uniform distribution model with parameters $a$ and $b$, noted $X\\sim U(a,b)$, if its range is $\\mbox{Ran}(X) = {a, a+1, \\ldots,b}$ and its probability function is\n$$f(x)=\\frac{1}{b-a+1}.$$\n  Observe that $a$ and $b$ are the minimum and the maximum of the range respectively.\nThe mean and the variance are\n$$\\mu = \\sum_{i=0}^{b-a}\\frac{a+i}{b-a+1}=\\frac{a+b}{2} \\qquad \\sigma^2 =\\sum_{i=0}^{b-a}\\frac{(a+i-\\mu)^2}{b-a+1}=\\frac{(b-a+1)^2-1}{12}$$\nExample. The variable that measures the outcome of rolling a dice follows a discrete uniform distribution model $U(1,6)$.\nBinomial distribution $B(n,p)$ Usually the binomial distribution corresponds to a variable measured in a random experiment with the following features:\n The experiment consist in a sequence of $n$ repetitions of the same trial. Each trial is repeated in identical conditions and produces two possible outcomes known as Success or Failure. The trials are independent. The probability of Success is the same in all the trials and is $P(\\mbox{Success})=p$.  Under these conditions, the discrete random variable $X$ that measures the number of successes in the $n$ trials follows a binomial distribution model with parameters $n$ and $p$.\n Definition - Binomial distribution $(B(n,p)$. A discrete random variable $X$ follows a binomial distribution model with parameters $n$ and $p$, noted $X\\sim B(n,p)$, if its range is $\\mbox{Ran}(X) = {0,1,\\ldots,n}$ and its probability function is\n$$f(x) = \\binom{n}{x}p^x(1-p)^{n-x} = \\frac{n!}{x!(n-x)!}p^x(1-p)^{n-x}.$$\n  Observe that $n$ is known as the number of repetitions of a trial and $p$ is known as the probability of Success in every repetition.\nThe mean and the variance are\n$$\\mu = n\\cdot p \\qquad \\sigma^2 = n\\cdot p\\cdot (1-p).$$\nExample. The variable that measures the number of heads after tossing 10 coins follows a binomial distribution model $B(10,0.5)$.\nAccording to this,\n The probability of getting 4 heads is  $$f(4) = \\binom{10}{4}0.5^4 (1-0.5)^{10-4} = \\frac{10!}{4!6!}0.5^40.5^6 = 210\\cdot 0.5^{10} = 0.2051.$$\n The probability of getting 2 or less heads is  $$\\begin{aligned} F(2) \u0026amp;= f(0) +f(1) + f(2) =\\newline \u0026amp;= \\binom{10}{0}0.5^0 (1-0.5)^{10-0} + \\binom{10}{1}0.5^1 (1-0.5)^{10-1} + \\binom{10}{2}0.5^2 (1-0.5)^{10-2} =\\newline \u0026amp;= 0.0547.\\end{aligned} $$\n And the expected number of heads is  $$\\mu = 10\\cdot 0.5 = 5 \\mbox{ heads}.$$\nExample. In a population there are a 40% of smokers. The variable $X$ that measures the number of smokers in a random sample with replacement of 3 persons follows a binomial distribution model $X\\sim B(3,,0.4)$.\n$$ \\begin{align*} f(0)\u0026amp;=\\displaystyle\\binom{3}{0}0.4^0(1-0.4)^{3-0}= 0.6^3,\\newline f(1)\u0026amp;=\\displaystyle\\binom{3}{1}0.4^1(1-0.4)^{3-1}= 3\\cdot 0.4\\cdot 0.6^2,\\newline f(2)\u0026amp;=\\displaystyle\\binom{3}{2}0.4^2(1-0.4)^{3-2}= 3\\cdot 0.4^2\\cdot 0.6,\\newline f(3)\u0026amp;=\\displaystyle\\binom{3}{3}0.4^3(1-0.4)^{3-3}= 0.4^3. \\end{align*} $$\nPoisson distribution $P(\\lambda)$ Usually the Poisson distribution correspond to a variable measured in a random experiment with the following features:\n The experiment consists of observing the number of events occurring in a fixed interval of time or space. For instance, number of births in a month, number of emails in one hour, number of red blood cells in a volume of blood, etc. The events occur independently. The experiment produces the same average rate of events $\\lambda$ for every interval unit.  Under these conditions, the discrete random variable $X$ that measures the number of events in an interval unit follows a Poisson distribution model with parameter $\\lambda$.\n Definition - Poisson distribution $P(\\lambda)$. A discrete random variable $X$ follows a Poisson distribution model with parameter $\\lambda$, noted $X\\sim P(\\lambda)$, if its range is $\\mbox{Ran}(X) = {0,1,\\ldots,\\infty}$ and its probability function is\n$$f(x) = e^{-\\lambda}\\frac{\\lambda^x}{x!}.$$\n  Observe that $\\lambda$ is the average rate of event for an interval unit, and it will change if the interval changes.\nThe mean and the variance are\n$$\\mu = \\lambda \\qquad \\sigma^2 = \\lambda.$$\nExample. In a city there are an average of 4 births every day. The random variable $X$ that measures the number of births in a day in the city follows a Poisson distribution model $X\\sim P(4)$.\nAccording to this,\n The probability that there are 5 births in a day is  $$f(5) = e^{-4}\\frac{4^5}{5!} = 0.1563.$$\n The probability that there are less than 2 births in a day is  $$F(1) = f(0)+f(1) = e^{-4}\\frac{4^0}{0!} + e^{-4}\\frac{4^1}{1!} = 5e^{-4} = 0.0916.$$\n The probability that there are more than 1 birth a day is  $$P(X\u0026gt;1) = 1-P(X\\leq 1) = 1-F(1) = 1-0.0916 = 0.9084.$$\nApproximation of Binomial by Poisson distribution The Poisson distribution can be obtained from the Binomial distribution when the number of trials repetition tends to infinite and the probability of Success tends to zero.\n Law or rare events. The Binomial distribution $X\\sim B(n,p)$ tends to the Poisson distribution $P(\\lambda)$, with $\\lambda=n\\cdot p$, when $n$ tends to infinite and $p$ tends to zero, that is,\n$$\\lim_{n\\rightarrow \\infty, p\\rightarrow 0}\\binom{n}{x}p^x(1-p)^{n-x} = e^{-\\lambda}\\frac{\\lambda^x}{x!}.$$\n  In practice, this approximation can be used for $n\\geq 30$ and $p\\leq 0.1$.\n \nExample. A vaccine produce an adverse reaction in 4% of cases. If a sample of 50 persons are vaccinated, what is the probability of having more than 2 persons with an adverse reaction?\nThe variable that measures the number of persons with an adverse reaction in the sample follows a Binomial distribution model $X\\sim B(50,0.04)$, but as $n=50\u0026gt;30$ and $p=0.04\u0026lt;0.1$, we can apply the law of rare events and use the Poisson distribution model $P(50\\cdot 0.04)=P(2)$ to do the calculations.\n$$ \\begin{aligned} P(X\u0026gt;2) \u0026amp;= 1-P(X\\leq 2) = 1-f(0)-f(1)-f(2) =\\newline \u0026amp;= 1-e^{-2}\\frac{2^0}{0!}-e^{-2}\\frac{2^1}{1!}-e^{-2}\\frac{2^2}{2!} =\\newline \u0026amp;= 1-5e^{-2} = 0.3233.\\end{aligned} $$\n  To distinguish population statistics from sample statistics we use Greek letters. \u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n   ","date":1461110400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1600206500,"objectID":"ba9fad09ad6c5312ddf502710f334f63","permalink":"/en/teaching/statistics/manual/discrete-random-variables/","publishdate":"2016-04-20T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/en/teaching/statistics/manual/discrete-random-variables/","section":"teaching","summary":"Random variables The process of drawing a sample randomly is a random experiment and any variable measured in the sample is a random variable because the values taken by the variable in the individuals of the sample are a matter of chance.","tags":["Statistics","Biostatistics","Random Variables"],"title":"Discrete Random Variables","type":"book"},{"authors":null,"categories":["Calculus"],"content":"Calculus formulas   Main Calculus formulas  Derivatives  Integrals  ","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1600206500,"objectID":"85066dc0c1cbf4c700bd9b4a270786a4","permalink":"/en/teaching/calculus/cheatsheets/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/en/teaching/calculus/cheatsheets/","section":"teaching","summary":"Everything you have to know at a glance","tags":["Cheat sheet"],"title":"Calculus Cheat Sheets","type":"book"},{"authors":null,"categories":["Calculus"],"content":"Exercise 1 Compute the derivative function of $f(x)=x^3-2x^2+1$ at the points $x=-1$, $x=0$ and $x=1$.

An increment of a variable $x$ is a change in the value of the variable; it is denoted $\\Delta x$. The increment of a variable $x$ along an interval $[a,b]$ is given by $$\\Delta x = b-a.$$    Definition - Increment of a function. The increment of a function $y=f(x)$ along an interval $[a,b]\\subseteq Dom(f)$ is given by $$\\Delta y = f(b)-f(a).$$   Example. The increment of $x$ along the interval $[2,5]$ is $\\Delta x=5-2=3$, and the increment of the function $y=x^2$ along the same interval is $\\Delta y=5^2-2^2=21$.\nAverage rate of change The study of a function $y=f(x)$ requires to understand how the function changes, that is, how the dependent variable $y$ changes when we change the independent variable $x$.\n Definition - Average rate of change. The average rate of change of a function $y=f(x)$ in an interval $[a,a+\\Delta x]\\subseteq Dom(f)$, is the quotient between the increment of $y$ and the increment of $x$ in that interval; it is denoted by $$\\mbox{ARC}\\;f[a,a+\\Delta x]=\\frac{\\Delta y}{\\Delta x}=\\frac{f(a+\\Delta x)-f(a)}{\\Delta x}.$$   Example - Area of a square. Let $y=x^2$ be the function that measures the area of a metallic square of side length $x$.\nIf at any given time the side of the square is $a$, and we heat the square uniformly increasing the side by dilatation a quantity $\\Delta x$, how much will increase the area of the square?\n$$ \\Delta y = f(a+\\Delta x)-f(a)=(a+\\Delta x)^2-a^2= a^2+2a\\Delta x+\\Delta x^2-a^2=2a\\Delta x+\\Delta x^2. $$\nWhat is the average rate of change in the interval $[a,a+\\Delta x]$? $$\\mbox{ARC}\\;f[a,a+\\Delta x]=\\frac{\\Delta y}{\\Delta x}=\\frac{2a\\Delta x+\\Delta x^2}{\\Delta x}=2a+\\Delta x.$$\nGeometric interpretation of the average rate of change The average rate of change of a function $y=f(x)$ in an interval $[a,a+\\Delta x]$ is the slope of the secant line to the graph of $f$ through the points $(a,f(a))$ and $(a+\\Delta x,f(a+\\Delta x))$.\nInstantaneous rate of change Often it is interesting to study the rate of change of a function, not in an interval, but in a point.\nKnowing the tendency of change of a function in an instant can be used to predict the value of the function in nearby instants.\n Definition - Instantaneous rate of change and derivative. The instantaneous rate of change of a function $f$ in a point $a$, is the limit of the average rate of change of $f$ in the interval $[a,a+\\Delta x]$, when $\\Delta x$ approaches 0; it is denoted by\n$$ \\begin{aligned} \\textrm{IRC}\\;f (a) \u0026amp;= \\lim_{\\Delta x\\rightarrow 0} \\textrm{ARC}\\; f[a,a+\\Delta x]=\\lim_{\\Delta x\\rightarrow 0}\\frac{\\Delta y}{\\Delta x}=\\newline \u0026amp;= \\lim_{\\Delta x\\rightarrow 0}\\frac{f(a+\\Delta x)-f(a)}{\\Delta x}. \\end{aligned} $$\nWhen this limit exists, the function $f$ is said to be differentiable at the point $a$, and its value is called the derivative of $f$ at $a$, and it is denoted $f'(a)$ (Lagrangeâs notation) or $\\frac{df}{dx}(a)$ (Leibnizâs notation).\n  Example - Area of a square. Let us take again the function $y=x^2$ that measures the area of a metallic square of side $x$.\nIf at any given time the side of the square is $a$, and we heat the square uniformly increasing the side, what is the tendency of change of the area in that moment?\n$$\\begin{aligned} \\textrm{IRC}\\;f(a)\u0026amp;=\\lim_{\\Delta x\\rightarrow 0}\\frac{\\Delta y}{\\Delta x} = \\lim_{\\Delta x\\rightarrow 0}\\frac{f(a+\\Delta x)-f(a)}{\\Delta x} =\\newline \u0026amp;= \\lim_{\\Delta x\\rightarrow 0}\\frac{2a\\Delta x+\\Delta x^2}{\\Delta x}=\\lim_{\\Delta x\\rightarrow 0} 2a+\\Delta x= 2a. \\end{aligned} $$\nThus, $$f'(a)=\\frac{df}{dx}(a)=2a,$$ indicating that the area of the square tends to increase the double of the side.\nInterpretation of the derivative  The derivative of a function $f'(a)$ shows the growth rate of $f$ at point $a$:\n $f'(a)\u0026gt;0$ indicates an increasing tendency ($y$ increases as $x$ increases). $f'(a)\u0026lt;0$ indicates a decreasing tendency ($y$ decreases as $x$ increases).    Example. A derivative $f'(a)=3$ indicates that $y$ tends to increase triple of $x$ at point $a$. A derivative $f'(a)=-0.5$ indicates that $y$ tends to decrease half of $x$ at point $a$.\nGeometric interpretation of the derivative We have seen that the average rate of change of a function $y=f(x)$ in an interval $[a,a+\\Delta x]$ is the slope of the secant line, but when $\\Delta x$ approaches $0$, the secant line becomes the tangent line.\nThe instantaneous rate of change or derivative of a function $y=f(x)$ at $x=a$ is the slope of the tangent line to the graph of $f$ at point $(a,f(a))$. Thus, the equation of the tangent line to the graph of $f$ at the point $(a,f(a))$ is $$y-f(a) = f'(a)(x-a) \\Leftrightarrow y = f(a)+f'(a)(x-a)$$\nKinematic applications: Linear motion Assume that the function $y=f(t)$ describes the position of an object moving in the real line at time $t$. Taking as reference the coordinates origin $O$ and the unitary vector $\\mathbf{i}=(1)$, we can represent the position of the moving object $P$ at every moment $t$ with a vector $\\vec{OP}=x\\mathbf{i}$ where $x=f(t)$.\nRemark. It also makes sense when $f$ measures other magnitudes as the temperature of a body, the concentration of a gas, or the quantity of substance in a chemical reaction at every moment $t$.\nKinematic interpretation of the average rate of change In this context, if we take the instants $t=t_0$ and $t=t_0+\\Delta t$, both in $\\mbox{Dom}(f)$, the vector $$\\mathbf{v}_m=\\frac{f(t_0+\\Delta t)-f(t_0)}{\\Delta t}$$ is known as the average velocity of the trajectory $f$ in the interval $[t_0, t_0+\\Delta t]$.\nExample. A vehicle makes a trip from Madrid to Barcelona. Let $f(t)$ be the function that determine the position of the vehicle at every moment $t$. If the vehicle departs from Madrid (km 0) at 8:00 and arrives at Barcelona (km 600) at 14:00, then the average velocity of the vehicle in the path is $$\\mathbf{v}_m=\\frac{f(14)-f(8)}{14-8}=\\frac{600-0}{6} = 100 km/h.$$\nKinematic interpretation of the derivative In the same context of the linear motion, the derivative of the function $f(t)$ at the moment $t_0$ is the vector\n$$\\mathbf{v}=f'(t_0)=\\lim_{\\Delta t\\rightarrow 0}\\frac{f(t_0+\\Delta t)-f(t_0)}{\\Delta t},$$\nthat is known, as long as the limit exists, as the instantaneous velocity or simply velocity of the trajectory $f$ at moment $t_0$.\nThat is, the derivative of the object position with respect to time is a vector field that is called velocity along the trajectory $f$.\nExample. Following with the previous example, what indicates the speedometer at any instant is the modulus of the instantaneous velocity vector at that moment.\nAlgebra of derivatives Properties of the derivative If $y=c$, is a constant function, then $y'=0$ at any point.\nIf $y=x$, is the identity function, then $y'=1$ at any point.\nIf $u=f(x)$ and $v=g(x)$ are two differentiable functions, then\n $(u+v)'=u'+v'$ $(u-v)'=u'-v'$ $(u\\cdot v)'=u'\\cdot v+ u\\cdot v'$ $\\left(\\dfrac{u}{v}\\right)'=\\dfrac{u'\\cdot v-u\\cdot v'}{v^2}$  Derivative of a composite function  Theorem - Chain rule. If the function $y=f\\circ g$ is the composition of two functions $y=f(z)$ and $z=g(x)$, then $$(f\\circ g)'(x)=f'(g(x))g'(x).$$    Proof  It is easy to proof this fact using the Leibniz notation $$\\frac{dy}{dx}=\\frac{dy}{dz}\\frac{dz}{dx}=f'(z)g'(x)=f'(g(x))g'(x).$$    Example. If $f(z)=\\sin z$ and $g(x)=x^2$, then $f\\circ g(x)=\\sin(x^2)$. Applying the chain rule the derivative of the composite function is $$(f\\circ g)'(x)=f'(g(x))g'(x) = \\cos(g(x)) 2x = \\cos(x^2)2x.$$\nOn the other hand, $g\\circ f(z)= (\\sin z)^2$, and applying the chain rule again, its derivative is $$(g\\circ f)'(z)=g'(f(z))f'(z) = 2f(z)\\cos z = 2\\sin z\\cos z.$$\nDerivative of the inverse of a function  Theorem - Derivative of the inverse function. Given a function $y=f(x)$ with inverse $x=f^{-1}(y)$, then $$\\left(f^{-1}\\right)'(y)=\\frac{1}{f'(x)}=\\frac{1}{f'(f^{-1}(y))},$$ provided that $f$ is differentiable at $f^{-1}(y)$ and $f'(f^{-1}(y))\\neq 0$.    Proof  It is easy to prove this equality using the Leibniz notation $$\\frac{dx}{dy}=\\frac{1}{dy/dx}=\\frac{1}{f'(x)}=\\frac{1}{f'(f^{-1}(y))}$$    Example. The inverse of the exponential function $y=f(x)=e^x$ is the natural logarithm $x=f^{-1}(y)=\\ln y$, so we can compute the derivative of the natural logarithm using the previous theorem and we get $$\\left(f^{-1}\\right)'(y)=\\frac{1}{f'(x)}=\\frac{1}{e^x}=\\frac{1}{e^{\\ln y}}=\\frac{1}{y}.$$\nSometimes it is easier to apply the chain rule to compute the derivative of the inverse of a function. In this example, as $\\ln x$ is the inverse of $e^x$, we know that $e^{\\ln x}=x$, so differentiating both sides and applying the chain rule to the left side we get $$(e^{\\ln x})'=x' \\Leftrightarrow e^{\\ln x}(\\ln(x))' = 1 \\Leftrightarrow (\\ln(x))'=\\frac{1}{e^{\\ln x}}=\\frac{1}{x}.$$\nAnalysis of functions Analysis of functions: increase and decrease The main application of derivatives is to determine the variation (increase or decrease) of functions. For that we use the sign of the first derivative.\n Theorem. Let $f(x)$ be a function with first derivative in an interval $I\\subseteq \\mathbb{R}$.\n If $\\forall x\\in I\\ f'(x)\u0026gt; 0$ then $f$ is increasing on $I$. If $\\forall x\\in I\\ f'(x)\u0026lt; 0$ then $f$ is decreasing on $I$.    If $f'(x_0)=0$ then $x_0$ is known as a critical point or stationary point. At this point the function can be increasing, decreasing or neither increasing nor decreasing.\nExample The function $f(x)=x^2$ has derivative $f'(x)=2x$; it is decreasing on $\\mathbb{R}^-$ as $f'(x)\u0026lt; 0$ $\\forall x\\in \\mathbb{R}^-$ and increasing on $\\mathbb{R}^+$ as $f'(x)\u0026gt; 0$ $\\forall x\\in \\mathbb{R}^+$. It has a critical point at $x=0$, as $f'(0)=0$; at this point the function is neither increasing nor decreasing.\n A function can be increasing or decreasing on an interval and not have first derivative.   Example. Let us analyze the increase and decrease of the function $f(x)=x^4-2x^2+1$. Its first derivative is $f'(x)=4x^3-4x$.\nAnalysis of functions: relative extrema As a consequence of the previous result we can also use the first derivative to determine the relative extrema of a function.\n Theorem - First derivative test. Let $f(x)$ be a function with first derivative in an interval $I\\subseteq \\mathbb{R}$ and let $x_0\\in I$ be a critical point of $f$ ($f'(x_0)=0$).\n If $f'(x)\u0026gt;0$ on an open interval extending left from $x_0$ and $f'(x)\u0026lt;0$ on an open interval extending right from $x_0$, then $f$ has a relative maximum at $x_0$. If $f'(x)\u0026lt;0$ on an open interval extending left from $x_0$ and $f'(x)\u0026gt;0$ on an open interval extending right from $x_0$, then $f$ has a relative minimum at $x_0$. If $f'(x)$ has the same sign on both an open interval extending left from $x_0$ and an open interval extending right from $x_0$, then $f$ has an inflection point at $x_0$.     A vanishing derivative is a necessary but not sufficient condition for the function to have a relative extrema at a point.   Example. The function $f(x)=x^3$ has derivative $f'(x)=3x^2$; it has a critical point at $x=0$. However it does not have a relative extrema at that point, but an inflection point.\nExample. Consider again the function $f(x)=x^4-2x^2+1$ and let us analyze its relative extrema now. Its first derivative is $f'(x)=4x^3-4x$.\nAnalysis of functions: concavity The concavity of a function can be determined by de second derivative.\n Theorem. Let $f(x)$ be a function with second derivative in an interval $I\\subseteq \\mathbb{R}$.\n If $\\forall x\\in I\\ f''(x)\u0026gt; 0$ then $f$ is concave up (convex) on $I$. If $\\forall x\\in I\\ f''(x)\u0026lt; 0$ then $f$ is concave down (concave) on $I$.    Example. The function $f(x)=x^2$ has second derivative $f''(x)=2\u0026gt;0$ $\\forall x\\in \\mathbb{R}$, so it is concave up in all $\\mathbb{R}$.\n A function can be concave up or down and not have second derivative.   Example. Let us analyze the concavity of the same function of previous examples $f(x)=x^4-2x^2+1$. Its second derivative is $f''(x)=12x^2-4$.\nFunction approximation Approximating a function with the derivative The tangent line to the graph of a function $f(x)$ at $x=a$ can be used to approximate $f$ in a neighbourhood of $a$.\nThus, the increment of a function $f(x)$ in an interval $[a,a+\\Delta x]$ can be approximated multiplying the derivative of $f$ at $a$ by the increment of $x$ $$\\Delta y \\approx f'(a)\\Delta x$$\nExample - Area of a square. In the previous example of the function $y=x^2$ that measures the area of a metallic square of side $x$, if the side of the square is $a$ and we increment it by a quantity $\\Delta x$, then the increment on the area will be approximately $$\\Delta y \\approx f'(a)\\Delta x = 2a\\Delta x.$$ In the figure below we can see that the error of this approximation is $\\Delta x^2$, which is smaller than $\\Delta x$ when $\\Delta x$ approaches to 0.\nApproximating a function by a polynomial Another useful application of the derivative is the approximation of functions by polynomials.\nPolynomials are functions easy to calculate (sums and products) with very good properties:\n Defined in all the real numbers. Continuous. Differentiable of all orders with continuous derivatives.  Goal Approximate a function $f(x)$ by a polynomial $p(x)$ near a point $x=a$.\nApproximating a function by a polynomial of order 0 A polynomial of degree 0 has equation $$p(x) = c_0,$$ where $c_0$ is a constant.\nAs the polynomial should coincide with the function at $a$, it must satisfy $$p(a) = c_0 = f(a).$$\nTherefore, the polynomial of degree 0 that best approximate $f$ near $a$ is $$p(x) = f(a).$$\nApproximating a function by a polynomial of order 1 A polynomial of order 1 has equation $$p(x) = c_0+c_1x,$$ but it can also be written as $$p(x) = c_0+c_1(x-a).$$\nAmong all the polynomials of degree 1, the one that best approximates $f(x)$ near $a$ is that which meets the following conditions\n $p$ and $f$ coincide at $a$: $p(a) = f(a)$, $p$ and $f$ have the same rate of change at $a$: $p'(a) = f'(a)$.  The last condition guarantees that $p$ and $f$ have approximately the same tendency, but it requires the function $f$ to be differentiable at $a$.\nImposing the previous conditions we have\n $p(x)=c_0+c_1(x-a) \\Rightarrow p(a)=c_0+c_1(a-a)=c_0=f(a)$, $p'(x)=c_1 \\Rightarrow p'(a)=c_1=f'(a)$.  Therefore, the polynomial of degree 1 that best approximates $f$ near $a$ is $$p(x) = f(a)+f \u0026lsquo;(a)(x-a),$$ which turns out to be the tangent line to $f$ at $(a,f(a))$.\nApproximating a function by a polynomial of order 2 A polynomial of order 2 is a parabola with equation $$p(x) = c_0+c_1x+c_2x^2,$$ but it can also be written as $$p(x) = c_0+c_1(x-a)+c_2(x-a)^2.$$\nAmong all the polynomials of degree 2, the one that best approximate $f(x)$ near $a$ is that which meets the following conditions\n $p$ and $f$ coincide at $a$: $p(a) = f(a)$, $p$ and $f$ have the same rate of change at $a$: $p\u0026rsquo;(a) = f'(a)$. $p$ and $f$ have the same concavity at $a$: $p''(a)=f''(a)$.  The last condition requires the function $f$ to be differentiable twice at $a$.\nImposing the previous conditions we have\n $p(x)=c_0+c_1(x-a) \\Rightarrow p(a)=c_0+c_1(a-a)=c_0=f(a)$, $p'(x)=c_1 \\Rightarrow p'(a)=c_1=f'(a)$. $p''(x)=2c_2 \\Rightarrow p''(a)=2c_2=f''(a) \\Rightarrow c_2=\\frac{f''(a)}{2}$.  Therefore, the polynomial of degree 2 that best approximates $f$ near $a$ is $$p(x) = f(a)+f'(a)(x-a)+\\frac{f''(a)}{2}(x-a)^2.$$\nApproximating a function by a polynomial of order $n$ A polynomial of order $n$ has equation $$p(x) = c_0+c_1x+c_2x^2+\\cdots +c_nx^n,$$ but it can also be written as $$p(x) = c_0+c_1(x-a)+c_2(x-a)^2+\\cdots +c_n(x-a)^n.$$\nAmong all the polynomials of degree $n$, the one that best approximate $f(x)$ near $a$ is that which meets the following $n+1$ conditions:\n $p(a) = f(a)$, $p'(a) = f'(a)$, $p''(a)=f''(a)$, $\\cdots$ $p^{(n)}(a)=f^{(n)}(a)$.  The successive derivatives of $p$ are\n$$ \\begin{aligned} p(x) \u0026amp;= c_0+c_1(x-a)+c_2(x-a)^2+\\cdots +c_n(x-a)^n,\\newline p'(x)\u0026amp; = c_1+2c_2(x-a)+\\cdots +nc_n(x-a)^{n-1},\\newline p''(x)\u0026amp; = 2c_2+\\cdots +n(n-1)c_n(x-a)^{n-2},\\newline \\vdots \\newline p^{(n)}(x)\u0026amp;= n(n-1)(n-2)\\cdots 1 c_n=n!c_n. \\end{aligned} $$\nImposing the previous conditions we have\n $p(a) = c_0+c_1(a-a)+c_2(a-a)^2+\\cdots +c_n(a-a)^n=c_0=f(a)$, $p'(a) = c_1+2c_2(a-a)+\\cdots +nc_n(a-a)^{n-1}=c_1=f'(a)$, $p''(a) = 2c_2+\\cdots +n(n-1)c_n(a-a)^{n-2}=2c_2=f''(a)\\Rightarrow c_2=f''(a)/2$, $\\cdots$ $p^{(n)}(a)=n!c_n=f^{(n)}(a)=c_n=\\frac{f^{(n)}(a)}{n!}$.  Taylor polynomial of order $n$  Definition - Taylor polynomial. Given a function $f(x)$ differentiable $n$ times at $x=a$, the Taylor polynomial of order $n$ of $f$ at $a$ is the polynomial with equation\n$$ \\begin{aligned} p_{f,a}^n(x) \u0026amp;= f(a) + f'(a)(x-a) + \\frac{f''(a)}{2}(x-a)^2 + \\cdots + \\frac{f^{(n)}(a)}{n!}(x-a)^n = \\newline \u0026amp;= \\sum_{i=0}^{n}\\frac{f^{(i)}(a)}{i!}(x-a)^i. \\end{aligned} $$\n   The Taylor polynomial of order $n$ of $f$ at $a$ is the $n$th degree polynomial that best approximates $f$ near $a$, as is the only one that meets the previous conditions.   Example. Let us approximate the function $f(x)=\\log x$ near the value $1$ by a polynomial of order $3$.\nThe equation of the Taylor polynomial of order $3$ of $f$ at $a=1$ is $$p_{f,1}^3(x)=f(1)+f'(1)(x-1)+\\frac{f''(1)}{2}(x-1)^2+\\frac{f'''(1)}{3!}(x-1)^3.$$ The derivatives of $f$ at $1$ up to order $3$ are\n$$ \\begin{array}{lll} f(x)=\\log x \u0026amp; \\quad \u0026amp; f(1)=\\log 1 =0,\\newline f'(x)=1/x \u0026amp; \u0026amp; f'(1)=1/1=1,\\newline f''(x)=-1/x^2 \u0026amp; \u0026amp; f''(1)=-1/1^2=-1,\\newline f'''(x)=2/x^3 \u0026amp; \u0026amp; f'''(1)=2/1^3=2. \\end{array} $$\nAnd substituting into the polynomial equation we get $$p_{f,1}^3(x)=0+1(x-1)+\\frac{-1}{2}(x-1)^2+\\frac{2}{3!}(x-1)^3= \\frac{2}{3}x^3-\\frac{3}{2}x^2+3x-\\frac{11}{6}.$$\nMaclaurin polynomial of order $n$ The Taylor polynomial equation has a simpler form when the polynomial is calculated at $0$. This special case of Taylor polynomial at $0$ is known as the Maclaurin polynomial.\n Definition - Maclaurin polynomial. Given a function $f(x)$ differentiable $n$ times at $0$, the Maclaurin polynomial of order $n$ of $f$ is the polynomial with equation\n$$ \\begin{aligned} p_{f,0}^n(x)\u0026amp;=f(0)+f'(0)x+\\frac{f''(0)}{2}x^2+\\cdots +\\frac{f^{(n)}(0)}{n!}x^n = \\newline \u0026amp;=\\sum_{i=0}^{n}\\frac{f^{(i)}(0)}{i!}x^i. \\end{aligned} $$\n  Example. Let us approximate the function $f(x)=\\sin x$ near the value $0$ by a polynomial of order $3$.\nThe Maclaurin polynomial equation of order $3$ of $f$ is $$p_{f,0}^3(x)=f(0)+f'(0)x+\\frac{f''(0)}{2}x^2+\\frac{f'''(0)}{3!}x^3.$$ The derivatives of $f$ at $0$ up to order $3$ are\n$$\\begin{array}{lll} f(x)=\\sin x \u0026amp; \\quad \u0026amp; f(0)=\\sin 0 =0,\\newline f'(x)=\\cos x \u0026amp; \u0026amp; f'(0)=\\cos 0=1,\\newline f''(x)=-\\sin x \u0026amp; \u0026amp; f''(0)=-\\sin 0=0,\\newline f'''(x)=-\\cos x \u0026amp; \u0026amp; f'''(0)=-\\cos 0=-1. \\end{array} $$\nAnd substituting into the polynomial equation we get $$p_{f,0}^3(x)=0+1\\cdot x+\\frac{0}{2}x^2+\\frac{-1}{3!}x^3= x-\\frac{x^3}{6}.$$\nMaclaurin polynomials of elementary functions $$ \\renewcommand{\\arraystretch}{2.5} \\begin{array}{cc} \\hline f(x) \u0026amp; p_{f,0}^n(x) \\newline \\hline \\sin x \u0026amp; \\displaystyle x - \\frac{x^3}{3!} + \\frac{x^5}{5!} - \\cdots + (-1)^k\\frac{x^{2k-1}}{(2k-1)!} \\mbox{ if $n=2k$ or $n=2k-1$}\\newline \\cos x \u0026amp; \\displaystyle 1 - \\frac{x^2}{2!} + \\frac{x^4}{4!} - \\cdots + (-1)^k\\frac{x^{2k}}{(2k)!} \\mbox{ if $n=2k$ or $n=2k+1$}\\newline \\arctan x \u0026amp; \\displaystyle x - \\frac{x^3}{3} + \\frac{x^5}{5} - \\cdots + (-1)^k\\frac{x^{2k-1}}{(2k-1)} \\mbox{ if $n=2k$ or $n=2k-1$}\\newline e^x \u0026amp; \\displaystyle 1 + x + \\frac{x^2}{2!} + \\frac{x^3}{3!} + \\cdots + \\frac{x^n}{n!}\\newline \\log(1+x) \u0026amp; \\displaystyle x - \\frac{x^2}{2} + \\frac{x^3}{3} - \\cdots + (-1)^{n-1}\\frac{x^n}{n}\\newline \\hline \\end{array} $$\nTaylor remainder and Taylor formula Taylor polynomials allow to approximate a function in a neighborhood of a value $a$, but most of the times there is an error in the approximation.\n Definition - Taylor remainder. Given a function $f(x)$ and its Taylor polynomial of order $n$ at $a$, $p_{f,a}^n(x)$, the *Taylor remainder* of order $n$ of $f$ at $a$ is the difference between the function and the polynomial,\n$$r_{f,a}^n(x)=f(x)-p_{f,a}^n(x).$$\n  The Taylor remainder measures the error int the approximation of $f(x)$ by the Taylor polynomial and allow us to express the function as the Taylor polynomial plus the Taylor remainder\n$$f(x)=p_{f,a}^n(x) + r_{f,a}^n(x).$$\nThis expression is known as the Taylor formula of order $n$ or $f$ at $a$.\nIt can be proved that\n$$\\lim_{h\\rightarrow 0}\\frac{r_{f,a}^n(a+h)}{h^n}=0,$$\nwhich means that the remainder $r_{f,a}^n(a+h)$ is much smaller than $h^n$.\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1606295051,"objectID":"c2c1680f6068dcb308d49e1be4b37a9b","permalink":"/en/teaching/calculus/manual/derivatives-one-variable/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/en/teaching/calculus/manual/derivatives-one-variable/","section":"teaching","summary":"Concept of derivative Increment  Definition - Increment of a variable.

That\u0026rsquo;s why data is usually presented in a graphical form, and for that reason spreadsheets provide different types of charts. This section presents the main chart types and how to plot them in Excel 2010.\nCharts creation Regardless the chart type, the steps to create a chart are:\n  Select the range that contains the data to plot. Data should be arranged in series (vertically or horizontally) following the next rules:\n Do not leave empty rows or columns within the data range or between data labels and data. Only one row and/or one column should be used for data labels. Each data label should be unique.    Select the type of chart from the Charts panel on the ribbon\u0026rsquo;s Insert tab.\n  Set the chart design (data serie to plot, order, etc.). You can use the ribbon\u0026rsquo;s Design tab.\n  Apply a layout (title, axis, legend, grids, data labels, etc.). You can use the ribbon\u0026rsquo;s Layout tab.\n  Apply a style format (text, line and background colours). You can use the ribbon\u0026rsquo;s Format tab.\n  Charts are embedded in the same worksheet that data by default but it\u0026rsquo;s possible to put it on a separate worksheet. For that right-clicking the chart background and select Move chart. In the dialog that appears select New sheet give a name to the worksheet a click OK.\nCharts are linked to data from which they come. This means that any change in the data will be immediately reflected in any derived chart.\nTypes of charts There are eleven major chart types (Column, Line, Pie, Bar, Area, Scatter, Stock, Surface, Doughnut, Bubble and Radar) and each has many subtypes.\nEach chart type has a purpose and requires data to be arranged in a particular way. So choosing the right chart is probably the most important decision. The main chart types and their purpose are presented below.\nColumn and bar charts A column or bar chart is a set of bars (usually rectangles) graphed over an horizontal and vertical axis (also known as XY axis). Each bar is graphed over the corresponding category with a length proportional to the value of the category in the data serie. Usually more than one data serie are plotted and bars corresponding to different series are differentiated with colours. In a column chart, categories appear horizontally and values appear vertically, whereas in a bar chart, categories appear vertically. Column charts, unlike bar charts, is suitable for emphasizing data variations over a period of time.\nExample. The next figure shows a column chart showing the evolution of fruit prices. Looking at the chart you can quickly realize that strawberries are the most expensive (longest bars) and apples the cheapest (shortest bars) along the time. Also that the prices of strawberries and bananas are decreasing, the prices of oranges are increasing and the prices of apples are almost stables.\nExcel offers a lot of shapes for the bars (rectangles, cylinders, cones, pyramids) in 2-D an 3-D, and allows to stack bars. Also is possible to add error bars to the bars.\nExample. The animation below shows how to create a column chart for the apple prices evolution (one data serie).\nAnd the animation below shows how to create a column chart for the fruit prices evolution (several data series).\nLine charts A line chart display a serie of data points called markers connected by straight line segments. Each marker is graphed over the corresponding category at a height proportional to the value of the category in the data serie. It\u0026rsquo;s similar to a column chart but using markers at the end of bars instead of bars, and joining them with straight line segments. Line charts are suitable for displaying and comparing trends over a period of time.\nExample. The next figure shows a line chart showing the evolution of fruit prices. Looking at the chart you can quickly realize that strawberries are the most expensive (higher markers) and apples the cheapest (lowest markers) along the time. Also that the prices of strawberries and bananas are decreasing (lines with negative slope), the prices of oranges are increasing (line with positive slope) and the prices of apples first decrease an then increases.\nExcel offers different subtypes of line charts, with or without data points in 2-D and 3-D, and also allows to stack lines.\nExample. The animation below shows how to create a line chart for the fruit prices evolution. Looking at the chart you can quickly realize which prices are increasing and which prices are decreasing.\nArea charts An area chart is similar to a line chart but filling the area between the line and the horizontal axis. Area charts are suitable for displaying the relative importance of values over time. It\u0026rsquo;ss similar to a line chart, but because the area between lines is filled in, the area chart puts greater emphasis on the magnitude of values and less emphasis on the flow of change over time.\nExample. The next figure shows an area chart showing the evolution of accumulated fruit prices. Looking at the chart you can quickly realize that strawberries are the most expensive (the largest area) and that accumulated prices are decreasing.\nExcel allows to plot areas in 2-D or 3-D and also to stack areas.\nExample. The animation below shows how to create an area chart for the evolution of accumulated fruit prices.\nPie charts A pie chart is a circle divided into slices called sectors. Each sector represents a category of the data serie an has an angle or area proportional to the quantity that correspond to the category.\nPie charts are suitable for displaying the parts of a whole. Unlike the other charts presented so far, which can graph multiple data series, pie charts can graph just one data series.\nExample. The next figure shows a pie chart comparing fruit prices. Looking at the chart you can quickly realize that strawberries are the most expensive (biggest sector) and apples are the cheapest (smallest sector).\nAgain Excel has several subtypes that allows you to emphasize a part of the whole in 2-D or 3-D.\nExample. The animation below shows how to create a pie chart comparing the fruit prices of January.\nDoughnut charts  Doughnut charts are similar to pie charts except for its ability to display more than one data series.\nExample. The next figure shows a doughnut chart comparing fruit prices in January and April. The inner doughnut correspond to prices of January and the outer to prices of April. Looking at the chart you can quickly realize that, although the price of apples were smaller in April than in January, it was relatively higher in April than in January, compared to the rest of fruit prices.\nExample. The animation below shows how to create a doughnut chart comparing the fruit prices in January and April.\nXY Scatter charts An XY scatter chart is a point cloud graphed using Cartesian coordinates. Each point correspond to a pair of values. The first value of the pair determines the position on the horizontal axis and the second value of the pair determines the position on the vertical axis. XY Scatter charts are suitable for displaying correlation among the data pairs of two numeric variables.\nExample. The next figure shows an XY Scatter chart relating banana and strawberry prices. Looking at the chart you can quickly realize that there is a positive correlation (when banana price increase, strawberry price increase too).\nExample. The animation below shows how to create an XY Scatter chart relating banana and strawberry prices.\nHistograms A histogram is a graphical representation of the distribution of numerical data. It\u0026rsquo;s similar to a column chart but data values are grouped into interval classes and each bar represents a class. Histograms charts are suitable for displaying frequency of data values in one numeric variable.\nTo plot an histogram previously is required to load the Analysis ToolPak add-in.\nExample. The animation below shows how to create an histogram of the grades in a course.\nChart design Changing the data source You can change the data range graphed in a chart anytime clicking the Select Data button of the Data panel on the ribbon\u0026rsquo;s Design tab. This brings a dialog where you can select the new data range, switch rows and columns series, add new data series to graph and their labels, remove or edit existing data series or change the order in which are graphed in the chart.\nObserve that is possible to plot in the same chart data in separated ranges.\nExample. The animation below shows how to add the orange prices data serie to a column chart for the apple prices evolution.\nSwitching rows and columns When Excel creates a new chart with x and y axis, it automatically graphs the data by rows in the selected range so that the column headings appear along the horizontal axis and the row headings appear in the legend. If you want to switch from row series to column series, that is, that row headings appear on the horizontal axis and the column headings appear in the legend, click the Switch Row/Column button of the Data panel on the ribbon\u0026rsquo;s Design tab.\nExample. The animation below shows how to switch from row series to column series in a column chart for the fruit prices evolution.\nChart layout After creating a chart you can add new layout elements like chart titles, axis titles, legends, data labels, grids, trend lines, error bars, etc. or modify the existing ones.\nTo format any element of a chart right-click the element (bar, line, title, axis, legend, etc) and select the corresponding option at the bottom of the contextual menu. This will open a dialog where you can perform the desired changes for the selected element.\nTitles You can add a title to the chart selecting the chart and clicking the Chart Title button of the Labels panel on the ribbon\u0026rsquo;s Layout tab. That will show a drop down menu that let you choose between a centered overlay title (inside the chart area) or an above chart (outside the chart area).\nExample. The animation below shows how to add a title to a column chart for the fruits prices evolution and how to change the font colour.\nAxes You can add a title to the horizontal or vertical axes selecting the chart and clicking the Axis Title button of the Labels panel on the ribbon\u0026rsquo;s Layout tab.\nExample. The animation below shows how to add a title to the horizontal and vertical axes of a column chart for the fruits prices evolution. The vertical axis title is rotated 90 degrees.\nOne of the most important parts of a chart are axis scales. Excel allows you to configure the axis scale setting the minimum and maximum showed in the axis, the major and minor units, the format of thick marks (small lines intersecting axis that indicate categories, scale units or chart data series) and their labels, or even the scale type (linear by default or logarithmic). To configure an axis right-click any label of the axis (not the axis title) and select the Format Axis option from the contextual menu. This will open a dialog with a lot of axis options. Change whatever you want and click Close.\nExample. The animation below shows how to change the scales of the horizontal and vertical axes of a column chart for the apple prices evolution. Observe that in the original chart the minimum value of the vertical axis scale is 1.26, what magnify the differences between month prices. To avoid that the minimum value of vertical scale is set to â¬0, and the major unit is set to â¬0.1. Also the format of tick marks labels is changed to currency with two decimal places. On the other hand, the tick marks labels of the horizontal axis are rotated 30 degrees counterclockwise.\nGrid A grid is composed of horizontal or vertical lines (usually equally spaced) over the axes. Grids are helpful to mark out more precisely the position of markers, bars, lines or other chart elements in the axis scales.\nExcel allows to plot both horizontal and vertical grid lines for major and minor tick marks. To plot vertical grid lines right-click any label of the horizontal axis and select the Add Major Gridlines option for drawing lines over the major tick marks, or Add Minor Gridlines for drawing lines over the minor tick marks. To plot horizontal grid lines do the same but right-clicking any label of the vertical axis. Once the grid line is plotted you can change its format right-clicking any label of the axis and selecting the Format Major Gridlines or Format Minor Gridlines option.\nExample. The animation below shows how add vertical major grid lines and horizontal minor grid lines. Also show how to change the line style of minor grid lines.\nLegends A legend is key that identifies patterns, colors, or symbols associated with the markers of a chart data series. The legend shows the data series name corresponding to each data marker.\nExcel usually plots a legend to the right of the chart but it\u0026rsquo;s possible to change the legend to other position or to remove it. To plot the lenged of a chart click the Legend button of the Labels panel on the ribbon\u0026rsquo;s Layout tab. This shows a drop down menu with different positions for the legend. After plotting the legend, if you want to format it right-click it and select Format Legend. This will open a dialog where you can choose the legend position, the frame and background colours and many other legend aspects. Finally if you want to remove a legend, just select it and press the Supr key.\nExample. The animation below shows how add a legend for the fruits to the right of a column chart with the fruit prices evolution. Also it shows how to plot a frame around the legend and how to move the legend to the top.\nData series The aspect of any graphic element used to represent a data serie in a chart (bars, markers, lines, sectors, etc) can be easily changed. To format the graphic element corresponding to a data serie right-click it and select the Format Data Series option. This will open a dialog where you can change the shape, border and background colours, space between elements, and many other aspects. It\u0026rsquo;s also possible to format only one element of the serie. For that you need to click it two times (not double-clicking), then right-click it and select the Format Data Point option.\nExample. The animation below shows how to change the background colour of orange bars in a column chart for the fruits prices evolution. It also shows how to add a glow effect over the highest bar.\nData labels Sometime is useful to plot the values for a data serie next to their bars, markers, lines, sectors or other chart elements. To plot the values of a data serie right-click the chart element (bar, marker, line, sector, etc) corresponding to the data serie and select the Data Labels option. This will plot the value corresponding to each bar, marker, sector, etc. close to it.\nExample. The animation below shows how add a legend for the fruits to the right of a column chart with the fruit prices evolution. Also it shows how to plot a frame around the legend and how to move the legend to the top.\nChart styles Finally, the Chart styles panel on the ribbon\u0026rsquo;s Design tab has many predefined chart styles that combine different colours for graphics elements and backgrounds. Apply one of those styles is as easy as select the chart an click the desired style.\nAlso, the Shape styles panel on the ribbon\u0026rsquo;s Format tab have predefined styles for the background area and frame of the chart.\nExample. The animation below shows how to apply some chart and shape styles to a column chart with the fruit prices evolution.\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1600206500,"objectID":"73bbf06356c8b605d786a699a05bfcb7","permalink":"/en/teaching/excel/manual/charts/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/en/teaching/excel/manual/charts/","section":"teaching","summary":" ","tags":["Excel"],"title":"Plotting Charts","type":"book"},{"authors":null,"categories":["Statistics","Biostatistics"],"content":"Probability distribution of a continuous random variable Continuous random variables, unlike discrete random variables, can take any value in a real interval. Thus the range of a continuous random variables is infinite and uncountable.\nSuch a density of values makes impossible to compute the probability for each one of them, and therefore, itâs not possible to define a probabilistic model trough a probability function like with discrete random variables.\nBesides, usually the measurement of continuous random variable is limited by the precision of the measuring instrument. For instance, when somebody says that is 1.68 meters tall, his or her true height is no exactly 1.68 meters, because the precision of the measuring instrument is only cm (two decimal places). This means that the true height of that person is between 1.675 y 1.685 meters.\nHence, for continuous variables, it makes no sense to calculate the probability of an isolated value, and we will calculate probabilities for intervals.\nProbability density function To model the probability distribution of a continuous random variable we use a probability density function.\n Definition - Probability density function. The probability density function of a continuous random variable $X$ is a function $f(x)$ that meets the following conditions:\n  It is non-negative: $f(x)\\geq 0$ $\\forall x\\in \\mathbb{R}$,\n  The area bounded by the curve of the density function and the x-axis is equal to 1, that is,\n$$\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} f(x)\\; dx = 1.$$\n  The probability that $X$ assumes a value between $a$ and $b$ is equal to the area bounded by the density function and the x-axis from $a$ to $b$, that is,\n$$P(a\\leq X\\leq b) = \\int_a^b f(x)\\; dx$$\n     The probability density function measures the relative likelihood of every value, but $f(x)$ is not the probability of $x$, cause $P(X=x)=0$ for every $x$ value by definition.   Distribution function The same way that for discrete random variables, for continuous random variables it makes sense to calculate cumulative probabilities.\n Definition - Distribution function. The distribution function of a continuous random variable $X$ is a function $F(x)$ that maps every value $a$ to the probability that $X$ takes on a value less than or equal to $a$, that is,\n$$F(a) = P(X\\leq a) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{a} f(x)\\; dx.$$\n  Probabilities as areas To calculate probabilities with a continuous random variable we measure the area bounded by the probability density function and the x-axis in an interval.\nThis area can be calculated integrating the density function or subtracting the distribution function that is easier,\n$$P(a\\leq X\\leq b) = \\int_a^b f(x), dx = F(b)-F(a)$$\nExample. Given the following function\n$$ f(x) = \\begin{cases} 0 \u0026amp; \\mbox{if $x\u0026lt;0$} \\newline e^{-x} \u0026amp; \\mbox{if $x\\geq 0$}, \\end{cases} $$\nletâs check that is a density function.\nAs this function is clearly non-negative, we have to check that total area bounded by the curve and the x-axis is 1.\n$$ \\begin{align*} \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty f(x)\\;dx \u0026amp;= \\int_{-\\infty}^0 f(x)\\;dx +\\int_0^\\infty f(x)\\;dx = \\int_{-\\infty}^0 0\\;dx +\\int_0^\\infty e^{-x}\\;dx =\\newline \u0026amp;= \\left[-e^{-x}\\right]^{\\infty}_0 = -e^{-\\infty}+e^0 = 1. \\end{align*} $$\nNow, letâs calculate the probability of $X$ having a value between 0 and 2.\n$$ \\begin{align*} P(0\\leq X\\leq 2) \u0026amp;= \\int_0^2 f(x)\\;dx = \\int_0^2 e^{-x}\\;dx = \\left[-e^{-x}\\right]^2_0 = -e^{-2}+e^0 = 0.8646. \\end{align*} $$\nPopulation statistics The calculation of the population statistics is similar to the case of discrete variables, but using the density function instead of the probability function, and extending the discrete sum to the integral.\nThe most important are:\n Definition - Continuous random variable mean The mean or the expectec value of a continuous random variable $X$ is the integral of the products of its values and its probabilities:\n$$\\mu = E(X) = \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty x f(x)\\; dx$$\n   Definition - Continuous random variable variance and standard deviation The variance of a continuous random variable $X$ is the integral of the products of its squared values and its probabilities, minus the squared mean:\n$$\\sigma^2 = Var(X) = \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty x^2f(x)\\; dx -\\mu^2$$\nThe standard deviation of a random variable $X$ is the square root of the variance:\n$$\\sigma = +\\sqrt{\\sigma^2}$$\n  Example. Let $X$ be a variable with the following probability density function\n$$ f(x) = \\begin{cases} 0 \u0026amp; \\mbox{si $x\u0026lt;0$}\\newline e^{-x} \u0026amp; \\mbox{si $x\\geq 0$} \\end{cases} $$\nThe mean is\n$$ \\begin{aligned} \\mu \u0026amp;= \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty xf(x)\\;dx = \\int_{-\\infty}^0 xf(x)\\;dx +\\int_0^\\infty xf(x)\\;dx = \\int_{-\\infty}^0 0\\;dx +\\int_0^\\infty xe^{-x}\\;dx =\\newline \u0026amp;= \\left[-e^{-x}(1+x)\\right]_0^{\\infty} = 1. \\end{aligned} $$\nand the variance is\n$$ \\begin{aligned} \\sigma^2 \u0026amp;= \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty x^2f(x)\\;dx -\\mu^2 = \\int_{-\\infty}^0 x^2f(x)\\;dx +\\int_0^\\infty x^2f(x)\\;dx -\\mu^2 = \\newline \u0026amp;= \\int_{-\\infty}^0 0\\;dx +\\int_0^\\infty x^2e^{-x}\\;dx -\\mu^2= \\left[-e^{-x}(x^2+2x+2)\\right]^{\\infty}_0 - 1^2 = \\newline \u0026amp;= 2e^0-1 = 1. \\end{aligned} $$\nContinuous probability distribution models According to the type of experiment where the random variable is measured, there are different probability distributions models. The most common are\n Continuous uniform. Normal. Studentâs T. Chi-square. Fisher-Snedecorâs F.  Continuous uniform distribution When all the values of a random variable $X$ have equal probability, the probability distribution of $X$ is uniform.\n Definition \u0026ndash; Continuous uniform distribution $U(a,b)$. A continuous random variable $X$ follows a probability distribution model uniform of parameters $a$ and $b$, noted $X\\sim U(a,b)$, if its range is $\\mbox{Ran}(X) = [a,b]$ and its density function is\n$$f(x)= \\frac{1}{b-a}\\quad \\forall x\\in [a,b]$$\n  Observe that $a$ and $b$ are the minimum and the maximum of the range respectively, and that the density function is constant.\nThe mean and the variance are $$\\mu = \\frac{a+b}{2}$$ and $$\\sigma^2=\\frac{(b-a)^2}{12}.$$\nExample. The generation of a random number between 0 and 1 is follows a continuous uniform distribution $U(0,1)$.\nAs the density function is constant, the distribution function has a linear growth.\nExample. A bus has a frequency of 15 minutes. Assuming that a person can arrive to the bus station in any time, what is the probability of waiting for the bus between 5 and 10 minutes?\nIn this case, the variable $X$ that measures the waiting time follows a continuous uniform distribution $U(0,15)$ as any waiting time between 0 and 15 is equally likely.\nThen, the probability of waiting between 5 and 10 minutes is\n$$ \\begin{aligned} P(5\\leq X\\leq 10) \u0026amp;= \\int_{5}^{10} \\frac{1}{15}\\;dx = \\left[\\frac{x}{15}\\right]^{10}_5 = \\newline \u0026amp;= \\frac{10}{15}-\\frac{5}{15} =\\frac{1}{3}. \\end{aligned} $$\nAnd the expected waiting (the mean) time is $\\mu=\\frac{0+15}{2}=7.5$ minutes.\nNormal distribution The normal distribution model is, without a doubt, the most important continuous distribution model as it is the most common in Nature.\n Definition - Normal distribution $N(\\mu,\\sigma)$. A continuous random variable $X$ follows a probability distribution model normal of parameters $\\mu$ and $\\sigma$, noted $X\\sim N(\\mu,\\sigma)$, if its range is $\\mbox{Ran}(X) = (-\\infty,\\infty)$ and its density function is\n$$f(x)= \\frac{1}{\\sigma\\sqrt{2\\pi}}e^{-\\frac{(x-\\mu)^2}{2\\sigma^2}}.$$\n  The two parameters $\\mu$ and $\\sigma$ are the mean and the standard deviation of the population respectively.\nThe plot of the probability density function of a normal distribution $N(\\mu,\\sigma)$ is bell shaped and it is known as a Gauss bell.\nThe bell shape depends on the mean $\\mu$ and the standard deviation $\\sigma$,\n The mean $\\mu$ sets the center of the bell. The standard deviation sets $\\sigma$ the width of the bell.   The plot of the distribution function of a normal distribution is S shaped.\nNormal distribution properties  It is symmetric with respect to the mean, and therefore, the coefficient of skewness is zero, $g_1=0$. It is mesokurtic, as the density function is bell shaped, and so, the coefficient of kurtosis is zero, $g_2=0$. The mean, median and mode are the same $$\\mu = Me = Mo.$$ It asymptotically approaches 0 when $x$ tends to $\\pm \\infty$. $P(\\mu-\\sigma \\leq X \\leq \\mu+\\sigma) = 0.68$   $P(\\mu-2\\sigma \\leq X \\leq \\mu+2\\sigma) = 0.95$   $P(\\mu-3\\sigma \\leq X \\leq \\mu+3\\sigma) = 0.99$  Example. It is known that the cholesterol level in females of age between 40 and 50 follows a normal distribution with mean 210 mg/dl and standard deviation 20 mg/dl.\nAccording to the Gauss bell properties, this means that\n The 68% of females have a cholesterol level between $210\\pm 20$ mg/dl, i.e., between 190 and 230 mg/dl. The 95% of females have a cholesterol level between $210\\pm 2\\cdot 20$ mg/dl, i.e., between 170 and 250 mg/dl. The 99% of females have a cholesterol level between $210\\pm 3\\cdot 20$ mg/dl, i.e., between 150 and 270 mg/dl.  Example of blood analysis. In blood analysis it is common to use the interval $\\mu\\pm 2\\sigma$ to detect possible pathologies. In the case of cholesterol, this interval is $[170\\text{ mg/dl}, 250\\text{ mg/dl}]$.\nThus, when a women between 40 and 50 years of age has a cholesterol level out of this interval, itâs common to think about some pathology. However this person could be healthy, although the likelihood of that happening is only 5%.\nThe central limit theorem This behavior is common in many physical and biological variables in Nature.\nIf you think about the distribution of the height, for instance, you can check that most people in the population have a height around the mean, but as the heights move away from the mean, both below and above the mean, there are few and few people with such a heights.\nThe explanation for this behavior is the , that we will see in the next chapter; it states that a continuous random variable whose values depends on a huge number of independent factors adding their effects, always follows a normal distribution.\nThe standard normal distribution $N(0,1)$ The most important normal distribution has mean zero, $\\mu=0$, and standard deviation one, $\\sigma=1$. It is known as Standard normal distribution and usually represented as $Z\\sim N(0,1)$.\nCalculation of probabilities with the normal distribution To avoid integrating the normal density function to compute probabilities itâs common to use the distribution function, that is given in a tabular format like the one below. For instance, to calculate $P(Z\\leq 0.52)$\n    0.00 0.01 0.02 \u0026hellip;     0.0 0.5000 0.5040 0.5080 \u0026hellip;   0.1 0.5398 0.5438 0.5478 \u0026hellip;   0.2 0.5793 0.5832 0.5871 \u0026hellip;   0.3 0.6179 0.6217 0.6255 \u0026hellip;   0.4 0.6554 0.6591 0.6628 \u0026hellip;   0.5 0.6915 0.6950 0.6985 \u0026hellip;   â® â® â® â® â®    $$0.52 \\rightarrow \\mbox{row }0.5 + \\mbox{column }0.02$$\nTo compute cumulative probabilities to the right of a value, we can apply the rule for the complement event. For instance,\n$$P(Z\u0026gt;0.52) =1-P(Z\\leq 0.52) = 1-F(0.52) = 1 - 0.6985 = 0.3015.$$\nStandardization We have seen how to use the table of the standard normal distribution function to compute probabilities, but, what to do when the normal distribution is not the standard one?\nIn that case we can use standardization to transform any normal distribution in the standard normal distribution.\n Theorem - Standardization. If $X$ is a continuous random variables that follow a Normal probability distribution model with mean $\\mu$ and standard deviation $\\sigma$, $X\\sim N(\\mu,\\sigma)$, then the variable that result of subtracting $\\mu$ to $X$ and dividing by $\\sigma$, follows a Standard Normal probability distribution,\n$$X\\sim N(\\mu,\\sigma) \\Rightarrow Z=\\frac{X-\\mu}{\\sigma}\\sim N(0,1).$$\n  Thus, to compute probabilities with a non-standard normal distribution first we have to standardize the variable before using the table of the standard normal distribution function.\nExample. Assume that the grade of an exam $X$ follows a normal probability distribution model $N(\\mu=6,\\sigma=1.5)$. What percentage of students didnât pass the exam?\nAs $X$ follows a non-standard normal distribution model, we have to apply standardization first, $Z=\\displaystyle \\frac{X-\\mu}{\\sigma} = \\frac{X-6}{1.5}$,\n$$ P(X\u0026lt;5) = P\\left(\\frac{X-6}{1.5}\u0026lt;\\frac{5-6}{1.5}\\right) = P(Z\u0026lt;-0.67). $$\nThen we can use the table of the standard normal distribution function,\n$$P(Z\u0026lt;-0.67) = F(-0.67) = 0.2514.$$\nTherefore, $25.14%$ of students didnât pass the exam.\nChi-square distribution  Definition - Chi-square distribution $\\chi^2(n)$. Given $n$ independent random variables $Z_1,\\ldots,Z_n$, all of them following a standard normal probability distribution, then the variable\n$$\\chi^2(n) = Z_1^2+\\cdots +Z_n^2,$$\nfollows a chi-square probability distribution with $n$ degrees of freedom.\n  Its range is $\\mathbb{R}^+$ and its mean and variance are $\\mu = n$ and $\\sigma^2 = 2n.$.\nExample. Below are plotted the density functions of some chi-square distribution models.\nChi-square distribution properties  The range is non-negative. If $X\\sim \\chi^2(n)$ and $Y\\sim \\chi^2(m)$, then $$X+Y \\sim \\chi^2(n+m).$$ It asymptotically approaches to a normal distribution as the degrees of freedom increase.  As we will see in the next chapter, the chi-square distribution plays an important role in the estimation of the population variance and in the study of relations between qualitative variables.\nStudentâs t distribution  Definition - Studentâs t distribution $T(n)$. Given a variable $Z$ following a standard normal distribution model, $Z\\sim N(0,1)$, and a variable $X$ following a chi-square distribution model with $n$ degrees of freedom, $X\\sim \\chi^2(n)$, independent, the variable\n$$T = \\frac{Z}{\\sqrt{X/n}},$$\nfollows a Studentâs t probability distribution model with $n$ degrees of freedom.\n  Its range is $\\mathbb{R}$ and its mean and variance are $$\\mu = 0$$ and $$\\sigma^2 = \\frac{n}{n-2}$$ if $n\u0026gt;2$.\nExample. Below are plotted the density functions of some student\u0026rsquo;s t distribution models.\nStudentâs t distribution properties  The mean, the median and the mode are the same, $\\mu=Me=Mo$. It is symmetric, $g_1=0$. It asymptotically approaches to the standard normal distribution as the degrees of freedom increase. In practice for $n\\geq 30$ both distributions are approximately the same. $$T(n)\\stackrel{n\\rightarrow \\infty}{\\approx}N(0,1).$$  As we will see in the next chapter, the Studentâs t distribution plays an important role in the estimation of the population mean.\nFisher-Snedecorâs F distribution  Definition - Fisher-Snedecorâs F distribution $F(m,n)$. Given two independent variables $X$ and $Y$ both following a chi-square probability distribution model with $m$ an $n$ degrees of freedom respectively, $X\\sim \\chi^2(m)$ and $Y\\sim \\chi^2(n)$, then the variable\n$$F = \\frac{X/m}{Y/n},$$\nfollows a Fisher-Snedecorâs F probability distribution model with $m$ and $n$ degrees of freedom.\n  Its range is $\\mathbb{R}^+$ and its mean and variance are $$\\mu = \\frac{n}{n-2}$$ and $$\\sigma^2 =\\frac{2n^2(m+nâ2)}{m(n-2)^2(n-4)}$$ if $n\u0026gt;4$.\nExample. Below are plotted the density functions of some Fisher-Snedecor\u0026rsquo;s F distribution models.\nFisher-Snedecorâs F distribution properties  The range is non-negative. It satisfies $$F(m,n) =\\frac{1}{F(n,m)}.$$ Thus, if we name $f(m,n)_p$ the value that satisfies $P(F(m,n)\\leq f(m,n)_p)=p$, then $$f(m,n)_p =\\frac{1}{f(n,m)_{1-p}}$$ which is helpful in order to compute probabilities from the table of the distribution function.  As we will see in the next chapter, the Fisher-Snedecorâs F distribution plays an important role in the comparison of population variances and in the analysis of variance test (ANOVA).\n","date":1461110400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1600206500,"objectID":"f27b27994d49369e7085870ab298be38","permalink":"/en/teaching/statistics/manual/continuous-random-variables/","publishdate":"2016-04-20T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/en/teaching/statistics/manual/continuous-random-variables/","section":"teaching","summary":"Probability distribution of a continuous random variable Continuous random variables, unlike discrete random variables, can take any value in a real interval.

Isaac Peral, 30 Bajo Albacete 12/01/1995 5,4 32    Database creation in Excel Excel allows to define databases as tables where fields are defined in columns and records in rows. The first row of the table contains labels for each field. This tables are also called data lists.\nTo create a data list first enter the name of the fields in the first row of the table, each in one column. This first row with the field names is the headers row. Field names must be unique and there musn\u0026rsquo;t be blank cells in the headers row. After creating the fields enter first record data in the appropriate columns of the row immediately below the one containing the field names. To Excel recognise this table as a data list, click the Format as Table button on the ribbonâs Home tab and then click a thumbnail of one of the table styles in the drop-down gallery.\nAfter that you can enter the remaining records, one by row. After entering the data of a field press the Tab key to go to the next field of the same record, or to the first field of the next record if you are in the last field of a record.\nExample. The animation below shows how create a data list of students with the fields First name, Last name, Address, City, Birth date, Average grade and Passed credits.\nAfter creating a data list Excel will give a name to it, but is advisable to give it a descriptive name (see the Naming cells and ranges section).\nData validation When entering data to a data list is important to validate data to maintain database integrity. Data validation allows to specify which type and range of data are accepted by a cell or field (column). To apply a validation rule to a field, select the field column of the data list and click Data validation button of the Data tools panel on the ribbon\u0026rsquo;s Data tab. In the dialog that appears, select the validation criteria from the drop-down list of the Setting:\n Whole number allows only integers numbers between a specified minimum and a maximum or greater o less than a specified number. Decimal allows decimal numbers between a specified minimum and maximum or greater or less than a specified number. List allows a list of defined entries. Date allows dates between two specified dates or before or after a specified date. Time allows times between two specified times or before of after a specified time. Text length allows text with a restricted length.  After selecting the validating criteria, enter the correspondent parameters (minimum or maximum numbers, dates, times or range with the entries of the list). You can also define an input message in the Input Message tab and an error message in the Error Alert tab that will be shown if an invalid entry is entered in the field.\nExample. The animation below shows how create a validation rule for the Average grade field in a data list of students.\nImporting databases Excel offers the possibility to import data from diverse sources like csv text files, XML files, relational databases like Access or web data sources.\nImporting data from csv text files To see how to import data from csv text file visit the section Import from csv format.\nImporting from web data sources There are many web pages that offers open data in a suitable format for import from Excel. To import data from a web data source click the From Web buttom of the Get External Data panel on the ribbon\u0026rsquo;s Data tab. This opens a web browser where you must enter the URL of the page with de data source. When the browser shows the data table some yellow arrows appears that allow you to select the rows and columns of the table to import.\nExample The animation below shows how to import the IBEX 35 serie from Yahoo finances.\nImporting data from Qandl  Quandl is a finance and economic data repository with hundred of open data series. It\u0026rsquo;s possible to import data from Qandl to Excel easily, but you need the Quandl add in for Excel. To install the Quandl add in for Excel follow these instructions.\nAfter installing the add in a new tab labelled Quandl appears in the ribbon. To import a data serie from Qandl, first search the data serie clicking the Search button on the ribbon\u0026rsquo;s Quandl tab, enter some key words for the search and click the Show Results button, select the data serie desired from the search results, click the Insert Selected Codes buttom and click the Close button. This will insert the Quandl code of the data serie (if you know the Quandl code of the data serie you can avoid the search and enter it directly in a cell). Finally, select the cell with the Quandl code and click the Download button on the ribbon\u0026rsquo;s Quandl tab. This will download the data serie and put it in a range below the cell that contais the Quandl code.\nExample The animation below shows how to import the IBEX 35 serie from Quandl.\n\nData sorting To sort the data list records on a single field, you simply click that fieldâs AutoFilter button (the button with the triangle that appears to the right of the header) and then click the appropriate sort option on its drop-down list:\n Sort A to Z or Sort Z to A in a text field. Sort Smallest to Largest or Sort Largest to Smallest in a number field. Sort Oldest to Newest or Sort Newest to Oldest in a date field.  Other option to sort a data list on a field is to select a cell of the field column an click the Sort A to Z button of the Sort \u0026amp; Filter panel on the ribbonâs Data tab, to sort ascending, or the Sort Z to A button to sort descending.\nExcel then will reorder all the records in the data list according to the ascending or descending order selected.\nExample. The animation below shows how to sort a students database. First ascending on the Birth date field, next descending on the Average degree field, and finally ascending on the Last name field.\nIf you need to sort a data list on more than one field, select a cell of the data list and click the Sort button of the Sort \u0026amp; Filter panel on the ribbon\u0026rsquo;s Data tab. Then, in the dialog that appears, select the first sorting field column and the sorting order (ascending or descending), next the second sorting field column an the sorting order, and so on.\nExample. The animation below shows how to sort a students database on the fields City ascending and Average grade descending.\nYou can also sort a range of cells in general indicating the name of the columns instead of the field names.\nSummarizing data With large tables or data lists is difficult to extract relevant information. For that purpose, Excel provides several methods for summarizing data.\nTotaling and subtotaling fields A common operation is to apply a function to a whole field in a data list, as for instance the SUM function for summarizing or the AVERAGE function for averaging all the values in a field column. This could be done activating the Total row check box of the Table Style Options panel on the ribbon\u0026rsquo;s Table Options tab. This will add a total row at the bottom of the table. Clicking any cell of this row you can choose which function to apply to the whole field.\nExample The animation below shows how to sum the passed credits of students in a students database. It also shows how to average the average grade.\nExcel also allows subtotaling a field by categories of other field. This procedure only works with data lists formatted like tables, so if a data list have been formatted like a table first it has to be converted to a range selecting any cell of the table and clicking the Convert to Range button of the Tool panel on the ribbon\u0026rsquo;s Table Tools - Design tab. After that, you have to sort the data list by the field with the categories to summarize (see the Data sorting section). Finally, to subtotaling a data list click the Subtotal button of the Outline panel on the ribbons' Data tab. This will display a dialog where you have to select the field with the categories in the At each change in drop-down menu, the function to apply (sum, count, average, etc.) in the Use function drop-down menu, check the fields to with apply the subtotaling function in the Add subtotal to list, and click OK.\nExample The animation below shows how to subtotaling the passed credits of students in a students database by the city where they live.\nPivot tables A pivot table is a powerful tool for exploring data. It help you organise and summarize the raw data in your data list, revealing patterns or relationships that might not be obvious at first glance.\nTo create a pivot table click on any cell of a data list and then click the PivotTable button on the ribbonâs Insert tab. This display a dialog where you can select the range for the pivot table (by default Excel select the whole data list) and choose between placing the pivot table in a new workbook (default) or in the same workbook (in this case you have to indicate in which cell). After click OK, a pane appears on the right side of the pane:\n Report Filter for the fields that enable you to page through the data summaries shown in the actual pivot table by filtering out sets of data â they act as the filters for the report. So, for example, if you designate the Year Field from a data list as a Report Filter, you can display data summaries in the pivot table for individual years or for all years represented in the data list. Column Labels for the fields that determine the arrangement of data shown in the columns of the pivot table. Row Labels for the fields that determine the arrangement of data shown in the rows of the pivot table. Values for the fields whose data are presented and summarized in the body cells of the pivot table. By default Excel will use the SUM function to summarize values. To use another function click the field and select the Value Field Settings option in the menu that appears. In the dialog that appears just select the function that you want to use for summarizing and click OK.  Example The animation below shows how to create a pivot table for a students database. The pivot table shows and summarizes the passed credits by degrees on rows and by cities on columns.\nThe animation below shows how to arrange the previous pivot table to show the passed credits summarized first by city and then by degree and vice versa, both on rows.\nThe animation below shows how to arrange the previous pivot table to show, in addition to the passed credits, the average grade of students. The passed credits are summarized using the SUM function while the average grade is summarized using the AVERAGE function.\nThe animation below shows how to filter the previous pivot table to show only the values of course year 2014 and not to show the physics degree.\nTo change the format of a pivot table you can use the Layout panel on ribbon\u0026rsquo;s PivotTable Tools - Design tab. This panel has four buttons:\n Subtotals Allows to show subtotals at top of groups, at bottom of groups or not to show subtotals. Grand Totals Allows to show grand totals for rows, for columns, for both rows and columns, or not to show grand totals. Report Layout Allows to show the groups in compact form (all the grouping fields in the same column), in outline form (every grouping field in a different column) or in tabular form (like the outline form but adding extra rows for the subtotals). Blank rows Allow to insert or not a blank row after each group.  It\u0026rsquo;s also possible to apply a predefined style to a pivot table just selecting the desired style from the PivotTable Styles panel on ribbon\u0026rsquo;s PivotTable Tools - Design tab.\nExample The animation below shows how to format and how to apply a style to the previous pivot table.\nPivot chart Pivot tables can be accompanied by pivot charts, that is an interactive chart where you can present and summarize data grouped by some fields like a in a pivot table. To create a pivot chart from a pivot table, in the worksheet with the pivot table click the PivotChart button of the Tools panel on the ribbon\u0026rsquo;s PivotTable Tools - Options tab. This will show a dialog with the charts types. Select the desired chart type and click OK. After that Excel inserts a chart in the same worksheet of the pivot table reflecting the same information of the pivot table. Fron now on, any change in the pivot table will be reflected in the pivot chart.\nExample The animation below shows how to create a pivot chart from a pivot table for a students database.\nOf course, you can change the pivot chart layout as any other chart (see section Chart layout).\nData filtering With huge databases it\u0026rsquo;s difficult to find the desired information. To overcome this problem Excel provide several methods to filter the database. Filtering is the procedure for specifying the data that you want displayed in an Excel data list.\nApply a simple filter The easiest way to perform this basic type of filtering on a field is to click the AutoFilter button (the button with the triangle that appears to the right of the header). This display a drop-down menu that contains at the end a list box with a complete listing of all entries made in that column, each with its own check box. In this list click the check box in front of the (Select All) option at the top of the fieldâs list box to clear the check boxes, then click each of the check boxes corresponding to the entries for the records you do want displayed in the filtered data list, and finally click OK. Excel then hides rows in the data list for all records except for those that contain the entries you just selected.\nExample The animation below shows how to filter the students of Sevilla and Albacete in a students database.\nTo perform more sophisticated filters you can use the other filter options of the AutoFiller button. These filter options depend on the type of entries in the field:\n  If the column only contains dates, the menu contains a Date Filters option with a submenu that allows you to filter dates equals to, before o after a given date; dates between two given dates; dates of today, yesterday and tomorrow; dates of this week, last week and next week; dates of this month, last month and next month; dates of this quarter, last quarter and next quarter; dates of this year, last year and next year; and dates in a specific period (quarter or month).\n  If the column contains only numbers or a mixture of dates with numbers, the menu contains a Number Filters option with a submenu that allows you to filter numbers equal or not equal to a given number; numbers greater than, greater than or equal to, less than, less than or equal to a given number; numbers between two given numbers; top 10 numbers; number above the average and numbers below the average.\n  If the column only text or a mixture of text, date and numbers, the menu contains a Text Filters option with a submenu that allows you to filter text equal or not equal to a given text; text that begins or end with a given text; and text that contains or does not contains a given text.\n  If the filter selected requires some parameter (date, number or text), a dialog appears where you must enter that data and click OK.\nExample The animation below shows how to filter the students born before 1/1/1995, with an average grade greater than or equal to 5, and whose name begins with M, in a students database.\nApply a complex filter Simple filters are enough in most cases, but sometime you need to filter data according to more complex criteria. Fortunately Excel provides a method to perform filters based on calculated criteria with formulas.\nTo perform a filter with calculated criteria first you have to specify the criteria somewhere in the worksheet that contains the data list. The criteria must have a cell header and a logical formula in the cell just below. In the logical formula you can use functions and references to the cells, but it\u0026rsquo;s important to note that all references must be to cells in the first row of the data list. After that, to apply the filter you need to select a cell in the data list and click the Advanced button of the Sort \u0026amp; Filter panel on the ribbons\u0026rsquo;s Data tab. This shows a dialog where you have to enter the range of the data list (usually Excel auto recognise it), the range of the filter criteria and click OK. Excel will apply the logical formula to every row of the data list and show only the records where the formula returns TRUE.\nExample The animation below shows how to filter the students with an average grade greater than or equal to 5, and a number of passed credits over the average, in a students database, using a calculated criteria. Observe how is used the data list name and the field name to reference the column of passed credits in the average calculation.\nClear a filter To clear an active filter in a data list click the AutoFilter button of the column with the active filter and select the option Clear Filter. After that Excel will show all the records hidden by the removed filter, but the rest of filters will continue active. To clear all the filters in a data list, select a cell of the data list and then click the Clear button of the Sort \u0026amp; Filter panel on the ribbons\u0026rsquo;s Data tab. This will show all the records of the data list.\nDatabase functions Excel have some predefined functions that can be applied to data list. Some of them apply other function only to records in a data list that match a criteria you specify.\nDefine a criteria The criteria must be defined in a range and must include at least one header with a field name that indicates the field whose values are to be evaluated and one cell just below with the value or expression to be used in the evaluation. The expression with the condition is a text string starting with a logical comparator (=,\u0026gt;,\u0026lt;,\u0026gt;=,\u0026lt;=,\u0026lt;\u0026gt;) or a pattern text with wildcards like the question mark ? (that matches any character) or the asterisk * (that matches any character string). You can specify multiple conditions in different columns. If you want to apply the function to all the records of the data list, just leave the cell with the criteria conditions blank.\nDSUM function The DSUM function sums the values in a numeric field (column) of records in a data list that match the criteria you specify. Its syntax is DSUM(database,field,criteria), where database is the range of the data list, field is the name of the field that contains the values to add up (it must be a numeric column) enclosed in double quotes, and criteria is the range that contains the criteria with the conditions you specify.\nExample The animation below shows how to sum the passed credits of students from Madrid born in 1994 or after with an average grade greater or equal to 6, in a students database.\nDCOUNT function The DCOUNT function counts the values in a numeric field (column) of records in a data list that match the criteria you specify. Its syntax is DCOUNT(database,field,criteria), where database is the range of the data list, field is the name of the field that contains the values to add up (it must be a numeric column) enclosed in double quotes, and criteria is the range that contains the criteria with the conditions you specify.\nExample The animation below shows how to count the students with an average grade greater than or equal to 6 whose name begins with L, in a students database.\nDMIN function The DMIN function returns the minimum in a numeric field (column) of records in a data list that match the criteria you specify. Its syntax is DMIN(database,field,criteria), where database is the range of the data list, field is the name of the field that contains the values to add up (it must be a numeric column) enclosed in double quotes, and criteria is the range that contains the criteria with the conditions you specify.\nDMAX function The DMAX function returns the maximum in a numeric field (column) of records in a data list that match the criteria you specify. Its syntax is DMAX(database,field,criteria), where database is the range of the data list, field is the name of the field that contains the values to add up (it must be a numeric column) enclosed in double quotes, and criteria is the range that contains the criteria with the conditions you specify.\nExample The animation below shows how to calculate the minimum and the maximum average grade of students from Madrid born before 1995, in a students database.\nDAVERAGE function The DAVERAGE function averages the values in a numeric field (column) of records in a data list that match the criteria you specify. Its syntax is DAVERAGE(database,field,criteria), where database is the range of the data list, field is the name of the field that contains the values to add up (it must be a numeric column) enclosed in double quotes, and criteria is the range that contains the criteria with the conditions you specify.\nExample The animation below shows how to average the average grades of students from Madrid born in 1994 or after with an average grade greater or equal to 6, in a students database.\nDSTDEVP function The DSTDEVP function calculates the standard deviation the values in a numeric field (column) of records in a data list that match the criteria you specify. Its syntax is DSTDEVP(database,field,criteria), where database is the range of the data list, field is the name of the field that contains the values to add up (it must be a numeric column) enclosed in double quotes, and criteria is the range that contains the criteria with the conditions you specify.\nExample The animation below shows how to calculate the standard deviation of average grades of students from Madrid born in Madrid before 1995, in a students database.\nDGET function The DGET function returns the value of field (column) in the record of a data list that match the criteria you specify. Its syntax is DGET(database,field,criteria), where database is the range of the data list, field is the name of the field that contains the values to return enclosed in double quotes, and criteria is the range that contains the criteria with the conditions you specify.\nIf no record satisfy the criteria, the function returns a #VALUE! error, and if more than one records satisfy the criteria the functions return a #NUM! error.\nExample The animation below shows how to find the student with the highest grade in a student database.\nOther functions allow to search values in a list or table.\nVLOOKUP and HLOOKUP functions The VLOOKUP function finds things in a table or list by row. Its syntax is VLOOKUP (value, table, col-index, [approx-match]), where value is the value you want to look up, table is the range of the table or list in which to perform the search, col-index is the the column number (starting with 1 for the left-most column of table range) that contains the return value, and approx-match is an optional logical argument that specifies whether to find an approximate match (TRUE by default) or an exact match (FALSE). The function looks the value argument up in the first column of the table argument. If the approx-match argument is TRUE, the table should be ordered by the firs column (the column where to look the value up) and the function will return the value of the col-index column in the same row that the closest value to value in the first column of the table range. If approx-match is false, the function will search for the exact value in the firs column and it will return the value of the col-index column in the same row that the first matched value in the first column. If no value in the first column matches the value argument, the function will return a #N/A error.\nExample The animation below shows how to look the phone up of a student in a students database.\nThe HLOOKUP function works like the VLOOKUP function but it performs a search by columns. Its syntax is HLOOKUP (value, table, row-index, [approx-match]), where value is the value you want to look up, table is the range of the table or list in which to perform the search, row-index is the the row number (starting with 1 for the top-most row of table range) that contains the return value, and approx-match is an optional logical argument that specifies whether to find an approximate match (TRUE by default) or an exact match (FALSE).\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1600206500,"objectID":"0bf14acea21eaa00b95813c4c2dc6e25","permalink":"/en/teaching/excel/manual/databases/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/en/teaching/excel/manual/databases/","section":"teaching","summary":" ","tags":["Excel"],"title":"Database Management","type":"book"},{"authors":null,"categories":["Calculus","One Variable Calculus"],"content":"Antiderivative of a function  Definition - Antiderivative of a function. Given a function $f(x)$, the function $F(X)$ is an antiderivative or primitive function of $f$ if it satisfies that $F'(x)=f(x)$ $\\forall x \\in \\mathop{\\rm Dom}(f)$.   Example. The function $F(x)=x^2$ is an antiderivative of the function $f(x)=2x$ as $F'(x)=2x$ on $\\mathbb{R}$.\nRoughly speaking, the calculus of antiderivatives is the reverse process of differentiation, and that is the reason for the name of antiderivative.\nIndefinite integral of a function As two functions that differs in a constant term have the same derivative, if $F(x)$ is an antiderivative of $f(x)$, so will be any function of the form $F(x)+k$ $\\forall k \\in \\mathbb{R}$. This means that, when a function has an antiderivative, it has an infinite number of antiderivatives.\n Definition - Indefinite integral. The indefinite integral of a function $f(x)$ is the set of all its antiderivatives; it is denoted by\n$$\\int{f(x)}\\,dx=F(x)+C$$ where $F(x)$ is an antiderivative of $f(x)$ and $C$ is a constant.\n  Example. The indefinite integral of the function $f(x)=2x$ is $$\\int 2x\\, dx = x^2+C.$$\nInterpretation of the integral We have seen in a previous chapter that the derivative of a function is the instantaneous rate of change of the function. Thus, if we know the instantaneous rate of change of the function at any point, we can compute the change of the function.\nExample. What is the space covered by an free falling object?\nAssume that the only force acting upon an object drop is gravity, with an acceleration of $9.8$ m/s$^2$. As acceleration is the the rate of change of the speed, that is constant at any moment, the antiderivative is the speed of the object,\n$$v(t) = 9.8t \\mbox{ m/s}$$\nAnd as the speed is the rate of change of the space covered by object during the fall, the antiderivative of the speed is the space covered by the object,\n$$s(t) = \\int 9.8t\\, dt = 9,8\\frac{t^2}{2}.$$\nThus, for instance, after 2 seconds, the covered space is $s(2) = 9.8\\frac{2^2}{2} = 19.6$ m.\nLinearity of integration Given two integrable functions $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ and a constant $k \\in \\mathbb{R}$, it is satisfied that\n $\\int{(f(x)+g(x))}\\,dx=\\int{f(x)}\\,dx+\\int{g(x)}\\,dx$, $\\int{kf(x)}\\,dx=k\\int{f(x)}\\,dx$.  This means that the integral of any linear combination of functions equals the same linear combination of the integrals of the functions.\nElementary integrals  $\\int a\\,dx=ax+C$, with $a$ constant. $\\int x^n\\,dx=\\dfrac{x^{n+1}}{n+1}+C$ if $n\\neq -1$. $\\int \\dfrac{1}{x}\\, dx=\\ln\\vert x\\vert+C$. $\\int e^x\\,dx=e^x+C$. $\\int a^x\\,dx=\\dfrac{a^x}{\\ln a}+C$. $\\int \\sin x\\, dx=-\\cos x+C$. $\\int \\cos x\\, dx=\\sin x+C$. $\\int \\tan x\\, dx=\\ln\\vert\\sec x\\vert+C$. $\\int \\sec x\\, dx = \\ln\\vert\\sec x + \\tan x\\vert+C$. $\\int \\csc x\\, dx= \\ln\\vert\\csc x-\\cot x\\vert+C$. $\\int \\cot x \\, dx= \\ln\\vert\\sin x\\vert+C$. $\\int \\sec^2 x\\, dx= \\tan x+ C$. $\\int \\csc^2 x\\, dx= -\\cot x+ C$. $\\int \\sec x \\tan x\\, dx= \\sec x+ C$. $\\int \\csc x \\cot x\\, dx = -\\csc x +C$. $\\int \\dfrac{dx}{\\sqrt{a^2-x^2}}=\\arcsin\\dfrac{x}{a}+C$. $\\int \\dfrac{dx}{a^2+x^2}=\\dfrac{1}{a}\\arctan\\dfrac{x}{a}+C$. $\\int \\dfrac{dx}{x\\sqrt{x^2-a^2}}=\\dfrac{1}{a}\\sec^{-1}\\dfrac{x}{a}+C$. $\\int \\dfrac{dx}{a^2-x^2}=\\dfrac{1}{2a}\\ln\\left\\vert\\dfrac{x+a}{x-a}\\right\\vert+C$.  Techniques of integration Unfortunately, unlike differential calculus, the is not a foolproof procedure to compute the antiderivative of a function. However, there are some techniques that allow to integrate some types of functions. The most common methods of integration are\n Integration by parts Integration by reduction Integration by substitution Integration of rational functions Integration of trigonometric functions  Integration by parts  Theorem - Integration by parts. Given two differentiable functions $u(x)$ and $v(x)$,\n$$\\int{u(x)v'(x)}\\,dx=u(x)v(x)-\\int{u'(x)v(x)}\\,dx,$$\nor, writing $u'(x)dx=du$ and $v'(x)dx=dv$,\n$$\\int{u}\\,dv=uv-\\int{v}\\,du.$$\n   Proof  From the rule for differentiating a product we have\n$$ (uv)' = u\u0026rsquo;v + uv' $$\nand computing the integrals both sides we get\n$$ \\begin{gathered} \\int (uv)' \\, dx = \\int u\u0026rsquo;v \\, dx + \\int uv'\\, dx \\Rightarrow\\newline uv = \\int v\\,du + \\int u\\, dv \\Rightarrow\\newline \\int{u}\\,dv=uv-\\int{v}\\,du. \\end{gathered} $$\n   To apply this method we have to choose the functions $u$ and $dv$ in a way so that the final integral is easier to compute than the original one.\nExample. To integrate $\\int{x \\sin x}\\,dx$ we have to choose $u=x$ and $dv=\\sin x\\, dx$, so $du=dx$ and $v=-\\cos x$, getting $$\\int{x \\sin x}\\,dx=-x\\cos x-\\int (-\\cos x)\\,dx = -x\\cos x +\\sin x.$$ If we had chosen $u=\\sin x$ and $dv=x\\,dx$, we would have got a more difficult integral.\nIntegration by reduction The reduction technique is used when we have to apply the integration by parts several times.\nIf we want to compute the antiderivative $I_{n}$ that depends on a natural number $n$, the reduction formulas allow us to write $I_{n}$ as a function of $I_{n-1}$, that is, we have a recurrent relation $$\\ I_{n}=f(I_{n-1},x,n)$$ so by computing the first antiderivative $I_0$ we should be able to compute the others.\nExample. To compute $I_{n}=\\int{x^ne^x}\\,dx$ applying integration by parts, we have to choose $u=x^n$ y $dv=e^x\\,dx$, so $du=nx^{n-1}\\,dx$ and $v=e^{x}$, getting\n$$\\ I_{n}=\\int{x^ne^x}\\,dx=x^ne^x-n\\int{x^{n-1}e^x}\\,dx=x^ne^x-nI_{n-1}.$$\nThus, for instance, for $n=3$ we have\n$$ \\begin{aligned} \\int x^3 e^x\\, dx \u0026amp;= I_3 = x^3e^x-3I_2 = x^3e^x-3(x^2e^x-2I_1) =\\newline \u0026amp;= x^3e^x-3(x^2e^x-(xe^x-I_0) = x^3e^x-3(x^2e^x-(xe^x-e^x) =\\newline \u0026amp;= e^x(x^3-3x^2+6x-6). \\end{aligned} $$\nIntegration by substitution  From the chain rule for differentiating the composition of two functions\n$$f(g(x))' = f'(g(x))g'(x),$$\nwe can make a variable change $u=g(x)$, so $du=g'(x)dx$, and get\n$$\\int f'(g(x))g'(x)\\, dx = \\int f'(u)\\, du = f(u)+C = f(g(x))+C.$$\n  Example. To compute the integral of $\\int{\\dfrac{1}{x\\log x}}\\, dx$ we can make the substitution $u=\\log x$, so $du=\\frac{1}{x}dx$, and we have\n$$\\int \\frac{dx}{x\\log x}=\\int \\frac{1}{\\log x}\\frac{1}{x}\\,dx = \\int \\frac{1}{u}\\,du = \\log \\vert u\\vert+ C.$$\nFinally, undoing the substitution we get\n$$\\int \\frac{1}{x\\log x}\\,dx= \\log \\vert\\log x\\vert + C.$$\nIntegration of rational functions Partial fractions decomposition A rational function can be written as the sum of a polynomial (with an immediate antiderivative) plus a proper rational function, that is, a rational function in which the degree of the numerator is less than the degree of the denominator.\nOn the other hand, depending of the factorization of the denominator, a proper rational function can be expressed as a sum of simpler fractions of the following types\n Denominator with a single linear factor: $\\dfrac{A}{(x-a)}$ Denominator with a linear factor repeated $n$ times : $\\dfrac{A}{(x-a)^{n}}$ Denominator with a single quadratic factor: $\\dfrac{Ax+B}{x^2+cx+d}$ Denominator with a quadratic factor repeated $n$ times: $\\dfrac{Ax+B}{(x^2+cx+d)^n}$  Antiderivatives of partial fractions Using the linearity of integration, we can compute the antiderivative of a rational function from the antiderivative of these partial fractions\n$$ \\begin{aligned} \\int \\frac{A}{x-a}\\,dx \u0026amp;= A\\log\\vert x-a\\vert+C,\\newline \\int \\frac{A}{(x-a)^n}\\,dx \u0026amp;= \\frac{-A}{(n-1)(x-a)^{n-1}}+C \\textrm{ si $n\\neq 1$}.\\newline \\int \\frac{Ax+B}{x^2+cx+d} \u0026amp;= \\frac{A}{2}\\log\\vert x^2+cx+d\\vert + \\frac{2B-Ac}{\\sqrt{4d-c^2}}\\arctan \\frac{2x+c}{\\sqrt{4d-c^2}}+C. \\end{aligned} $$\nIntegration of a rational function with a denominator with linear factors Example. Consider the function $f(x)=\\dfrac{x^2+3x-5}{x^3-3x+2}$.\nThe factorization of the denominator is $x^3-3x+2=(x-1)^2(x+2)$; it has a single linear factor $(x+2)$ and a linear factor $(x-1)$, repeated two times. In this case the decomposition in partial fractions is:\n$$ \\begin{aligned} \\frac{x^2+3x-5}{x^3-3x+2}\u0026amp;=\\frac{A}{x-1}+\\frac{B}{(x-1)^2}+\\frac{C}{x+2} = \\newline \u0026amp;= \\frac{A(x-1)(x+2)+ B(x+2)+C(x-1)^2}{(x-1)^2(x+2)} = \\newline \u0026amp;= \\frac{(A+C)x^2+(A+B-2C)x+(-2A+2B+C)}{(x-1)^2(x+2)} \\end{aligned} $$\nand equating the numerators we get $A=16/9$, $B=-1/3$ and $C=-7/9$, so\n$$\\frac{x^2+3x-5}{x^3-3x+2}= \\frac{16/9}{x-1}+\\frac{-1/3}{(x-1)^2}+\\frac{-7/9}{x+2}.$$\nFinally, integrating each partial fraction we have\n$$ \\begin{aligned} \\int \\frac{x^2+3x-5}{x^3-3x+2}\\, dx \u0026amp;= \\int \\frac{16/9}{x-1}\\,dx+\\int \\frac{-1/3}{(x-1)^2}\\,dx+\\int \\frac{-7/9}{x+2}\\,dx = \\newline \u0026amp;= \\frac{16}{9}\\int\\frac{1}{x-1}\\,dx-\\frac{1}{3}\\int(x-1)^{-2}\\,dx- \\frac{7}{9}\\int \\frac{1}{x+2}\\,dx = \\newline \u0026amp;= \\frac{16}{9}\\ln\\vert x-1\\vert+\\frac{1}{3(x-1)}-\\frac{7}{9}\\ln\\vert x+2\\vert+C. \\end{aligned} $$\nIntegration of a rational function with a denominator with simple quadratic factors Example. Consider the function $f(x)=\\dfrac{x+1}{x^2-4x+8}$.\nIn this case the denominator cannot be factorised as a product of linear factors, but we can write\n$$x^2-4x+8 = (x-2)^2+4,$$\nso\n$$ \\begin{aligned} \\int \\dfrac{x+1}{x^2-4x+8}\\, dx \u0026amp;= \\int \\dfrac{x-2+3}{(x-2)^2+4}\\,dx = \\newline \u0026amp;= \\int \\dfrac{x-2}{(x-2)^2+4}\\,dx + \\int \\dfrac{3}{(x-2)^2+4}\\,dx = \\newline \u0026amp;= \\frac{1}{2}\\ln\\vert(x-2)^2+4\\vert + \\dfrac{3}{2}\\arctan\\left(\\frac{x-2}{2}\\right)+C. \\end{aligned} $$\nIntegration of trigonometric functions Integration of $\\sin^n x\\cos^m x$ with $n$ or $m$ odd  If $f(x)=\\sin^n x\\cos^m x$ with $n$ or $m$ odd, then we can make the substitution $t=\\sin x$ or $t=\\cos x$, to convert the function into a polynomial.   Example.\n$$\\int \\sin^2 x\\cos^3 x\\, dx = \\int \\sin^2 x\\cos^2 x\\cos x\\, dx = \\int \\sin^2 x(1-\\sin^2 x)\\cos x\\, dx,$$\nand making the substitution $t=\\sin x$, so $dt = \\cos x dx$, we have\n$$\\int \\sin^2 x(1-\\sin^2 x)\\cos x\\, dx = \\int t^2(1-t^2)\\, dt = \\int t^2-t^4 \\, dt = \\frac{t^3}{3}-\\frac{t^5}{5}+C.$$\nFinally, undoing the substitution we have\n$$\\int \\sin^2 x\\cos^3 x\\, dx = \\frac{\\sin^3 x}{3}-\\frac{\\sin^5 x}{5}+C.$$\nIntegration of $\\sin^n x\\cos^m x$ with $n$ and $m$ even  If $f(x)=\\sin^n x\\cos^m x$ with $n$ and $m$ even, then we can make the following substitutions to simplify the integration\n$$ \\begin{aligned} \\sin^2 x \u0026amp;= \\frac{1}{2}(1-\\cos(2x))\\newline \\cos^2 x \u0026amp;= \\frac{1}{2}(1+\\cos(2x))\\newline \\sin x\\cos x \u0026amp;= \\frac{1}{2}\\sin(2x) \\end{aligned} $$\n  Example.\n$$ \\begin{aligned} \\int \\sin^2 x\\cos^4 x\\, dx \u0026amp;= \\int (\\sin x\\cos x)^2\\cos^2 x\\, dx = \\int \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\sin(2x)\\right)^2\\frac{1}{2}(1+\\cos(2x))\\,dx =\\newline \u0026amp;= \\frac{1}{8}\\int \\sin^2(2x)\\,dx+\\frac{1}{8}\\int \\sin^2(2x) \\cos(2x)\\,dx, \\end{aligned} $$\nthe first integral is of the same type and the second one of the previous type, so $$\\int \\sin^2 x\\cos^4 x\\, dx = \\frac{1}{32}x-\\frac{1}{32}\\sin(2x)+\\frac{1}{24}\\sin^3(2x).$$\nProducts of sines and cosines  The equalities\n$$ \\begin{aligned} \\sin x\\cos y \u0026amp;= \\frac{1}{2}(\\sin(x-y)+\\sin(x+y))\\newline \\sin x\\sin y \u0026amp;= \\frac{1}{2}(\\cos(x-y)-\\cos(x+y))\\newline \\cos x\\cos y \u0026amp;= \\frac{1}{2}(\\cos(x-y)+\\cos(x+y)) \\end{aligned} $$\ntransform products in sums, simplifying the integration.\n  Example.\n$$ \\begin{aligned} \\int \\sin x\\cos 2x\\, dx \u0026amp;= \\int \\frac{1}{2}(\\sin(x-2x)+\\sin(x+2x))\\,dx = \\newline \u0026amp;= \\frac{1}{2}\\int \\sin (-x)\\,dx +\\frac{1}{2}\\int \\sin 3x\\,dx = \\newline \u0026amp;= \\frac{1}{2}\\cos(-x)- \\frac{1}{6}\\cos 3x +C. \\end{aligned} $$\nRational functions of sines and cosines  If $f(x,y)$ is a rational function then the function $f(\\sin x,\\cos x)$ can be transformed in an rational function of $t$ with the following substitutions\n$$\\tan \\frac{x}{2}=t \\quad \\sin x=\\frac{2t}{1+t^2} \\quad \\cos x = \\frac{1-t^2}{1+t^2} \\quad dx = \\frac{2}{1+t^2}dt.$$\n  Example.\n$$\\int \\frac{1}{\\sin x}\\,dx = \\int \\frac{1}{\\frac{2t}{1+t^2}}\\frac{2}{1+t^2}\\,dt = \\int \\frac{1}{t}\\,dt = \\log\\vert t\\vert+C = \\log\\vert\\tan\\frac{x}{2}\\vert+C.$$\nDefinite integral  Definition - Definite integral. Let $f(x)$ be a function which is continuous on an interval $[a, b]$. Divide this interval into $n$ subintervals of equal width $\\Delta x$ and choose an arbitrary point $x_i$ from each subinterval.

An ordinary differential equation (O.D.E.) is a equation that relates an independent variable $x$, a function $y(x)$ that depends on $x$, and the successive derivatives of $y$, $y',y'',\\ldots,y^{(n)}$; it can be written as\n$$F(x, y, y', y'',\\ldots, y^{(n)})=0.$$\nThe order of a differential equation is the greatest order of the derivatives in the equation.\n  Example. The equation $y'''+sen(x)y'=2x$ is a differential equation of order 3.\nDeducing a differential equation To deduce a differential equation that explains a natural phenomenon is essential to understand what a derivative is and how to interpret it.\nExample. Newtonâs law of cooling states\n âThe rate of change of the temperature of a body in a surrounding medium is proportional to the difference between the temperature of the body $T$ and the temperature of the medium $T_a$.â\n The rate of change of the temperature is the derivative of temperature with respect to time $dT/dt$. Thus, Newtonâs law of cooling can be explained by the differential equation\n$$\\frac{dT}{dt}=k(T-T_a),$$\nwhere $k$ is a proportionality constant.\nSolution of an ordinary differential equation  Definition - Solution of an ordinary differential equation. Given an ordinary differential equation $F(x,y,y',y'',\\ldots,y^{(n})=0$, the function $y=f(x)$ is a solution of the ordinary differential equation if it satisfies the equation, that is, if\n$$F(x,f(x), f'(x), f''(x),\\ldots, f^{(n}(x))=0.$$\nThe graph of a solution of the ordinary differential equation is known as integral curve.\n  Solving an ordinary differential equations consists on finding all its solutions in a given domain. For that integral calculus is required.\nThe same manner than the indefinite integral is a family of antiderivatives, that differ in a constant term, after integrating an ordinary differential equation we get a family of solutions that differ in a constant. We can get particular solutions giving values to this constant.\nGeneral solution of an ordinary differential equation  Definition - General solution of an ordinary differential equation. Given an ordinary differential equation $F(x,y,y',y'',\\ldots,y^{(n})=0$ of order $n$, the general solution of the differential equation is a family of functions\n$$y =f (x,C_1,\\ldots,C_n),$$\ndepending on $n$ constants, such that for any value of $C_1,\\ldots,C_n$ we get a solution of the differential equation.\n  For every value of the constant we get particular solution of the differential equation. Thus, when a differential equation can be solved, it has infinite solutions.\nGeometrically, the general solution of a differential equation corresponds to a family of integral curves of the differential equation.\nOften, it is common to impose conditions to the solutions of a differential equation to reduce the number of solutions. In many cases, these conditions allow to determine the values of the constants in the general solution to get a particular solution.\nFirst order differential equations In this chapter we are going to study first order differential equations\n$$F(x,y,y')=0.$$\nThe general solution of a first order differential equation is\n$$y = f (x,C),$$\nso to get a particular solution from the general one, it is enough to set the value of the constant $C$, and for that we only need to impose one initial condition.\n Definition - Initial value problem. The group consisting of a first order differential equation and an initial condition is known as initial value problem:\n$$ \\begin{cases} F(x,y,y')=0, \u0026amp; \\mbox{First order differential equation;} \\newline y(x_0)=y_0, \u0026amp; \\mbox{Initial condition.} \\end{cases} $$\n  Solving an initial value problem consists in finding a solution of the first order differential equation that satisfies the initial condition.\nExample. Recall the first order differential equation of the Newtonâs law of cooling, $$\\frac{dT}{dt}=k(T-T_a),$$ where $T$ is the temperature of the body and $T_a$ is the temperature of the surrounding medium.\nIt is easy to check that the general solution of this equation is\n$$T(t) = Ce^{kt}+T_a.$$\nIf we impose the initial condition that the temperature of the body at the initial instant is $5$ ÂºC, that is, $T(0)=5$, we have\n$$T(0) = Ce^{k\\cdot0}+T_a = C+T_a = 5,$$\nfrom where we get $C=5-T_a$, and this give us the particular solution\n$$T(t) = (5-T_a)e^{kt}+T_a.$$\nIntegral curve of an initial value problem Example. If we assume in the previous example that the temperature of the surrounding medium is $T_a=0$ ÂºC and the cooling constant of the body is $k=1$, the general solution of the differential equation is $$T(t)=Ce^t,$$ that is a family of integral curves. Among all of them, only the one that passes through the point $(0,5)$ corresponds to the particular solution of the previous initial value problem.\nExistence and uniqueness of solutions  Theorem - Existence and uniqueness of solutions of a first order ODE. Given an initial value problem\n$$\\begin{cases} y'=F(x,y);\\newline y(x_0)=y_0; \\end{cases} $$\nif $F(x,y(x))$ is a function continuous on an open interval around the point $(x_0,y_0)$, then a solution of the initial value problem exists. If, in addition, $\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial y}$ is continuous in an open interval around $(x_0,y_0)$, the solution is unique.\n  Although this theorem guarantees the existence and uniqueness of a solution of a first order differential equation, it does not provide a method to compute it. In fact, there is not a general method to solve first order differential equations, but we will see how to solve some types:\n  Separable differential equations  Homogeneous differential equations  Linear differential equations  Separable differential equations  Definition - Separable differential equation. A separable differential equation is a first order differential equation that can be written as\n$$y\u0026rsquo;g(y)=f(x),$$\nor what is the same,\n$$g(y)dy=f(x)dx,$$\nso the different variables are on different sides of the equality (the variables are separated).\n   The general solution for a separable differential equation comes after integrating both sides of the equation\n$$\\int g(y)\\,dy = \\int f(x)\\,dx+C.$$\n  Example. The differential equation of the Newtonâs law of cooling\n$$\\frac{dT}{dt}=k(T-T_a),$$\nis a separable differential equation since it can be written as\n$$\\frac{1}{T-T_a}dT=k\\,dt.$$\nIntegrating both sides of the equation we have\n$$\\int \\frac{1}{T-T_a}\\,dT=\\int k\\,dt\\Leftrightarrow \\log(T-T_a)=kt+C,$$\nand solving for $T$ we get the general solution of the equation\n$$T(t)=e^{kt+C}+T_a=e^Ce^{kt}+T_a=Ce^{kt}+T_a,$$\nrewriting $C=e^C$ as an arbitrary constant.\nHomogeneous differential equations  Definition - Homogeneous function. A function $f(x,y)$ is homogeneous of degree $n$, if it satisfies\n$$f(kx,ky)= k^nf(x,y),$$\nfor any value $k\\in \\mathbb{R}$.\n  In particular, a homogeneous function of degree $0$ always satisfies\n$$f(kx,ky)=f(x,y).$$\nSetting $k=1/x$ we have\n$$f(x,y)=f\\left(\\frac{1}{x}x,\\frac{1}{x}y\\right)=f\\left(1,\\frac{y}{x}\\right)=g\\left(\\frac{y}{x}\\right).$$\nThis way, a homogeneous function of degree $0$ always can be written as a function of $u=y/x$:\n$$f(x,y)=g\\left(\\frac{y}{x}\\right)=g(u).$$\n Definition - Homogeneous differential equation. A homogeneous differential equation is a first order differential equation that can be written as\n$$y'=f(x,y),$$\nwhere $f(x,y)$ is a homogeneous function of degree $0$.\n   We can solve a homogeneous differential equation by making the substitution\n$$u=\\frac{y}{x}\\Leftrightarrow y=ux,$$\nso the equation becomes\n$$u\u0026rsquo;x+u=f(u),$$\nthat is a separable differential equation.\n  Once solved the separable differential equation, the substitution must be undone.\nExample. Let us consider the following differential equation $$4x-3y+y'(2y-3x)=0.$$\nRewriting the equation in this way\n$$y'=\\frac{3y-4x}{2y-3x}$$\nwe can easily check that it is a homogeneous differential equation.\nTo solve this equation we have to do the substitution $y=ux$, and we get\n$$u\u0026rsquo;x+u=\\frac{3ux-4x}{2ux-3x}=\\frac{3u-4}{2u-3}$$\nthat is a separable differential equation.\nSeparating the variables we have\n$$u\u0026rsquo;x=\\frac{3u-4}{2u-3}-u=\\frac{-2u^2+6u-4}{2u-3}\\Leftrightarrow \\frac{2u-3}{-2u^2+6u-4}\\,du=\\frac{1}{x}\\,dx.$$\nNow, integrating both sides of the equation we have\n$$ \\renewcommand{\\arraystretch}{2} \\begin{array}{c} \\displaystyle \\int \\frac{2u-3}{-2u^2+6u-4}\\,du=\\int \\frac{1}{x}\\,dx \\Leftrightarrow -\\frac{1}{2}\\log|u^2-3u+2|=\\log|x|+C \\Leftrightarrow\\newline \\Leftrightarrow \\log|u^2-3u+2|=-2\\log|x|-2C, \\end{array} $$\nthen, applying the exponential function to both sides and simplifying we get the general solution\n$$u^2-3u+2=e^{-2\\log|x|-2C}=\\frac{e^{-2C}}{e^{\\log|x|^2}}=\\frac{C}{x^2},$$\nrewriting the constant $K=e^{-2C}$.\nFinally, undoing the initial substitution $u=y/x$, we arrive at the general solution of the homogeneous differential equation\n$$\\left(\\frac{y}{x}\\right)^2-3\\frac{y}{x}+2=\\frac{K}{x^2}\\Leftrightarrow y^2-3xy+2x^2=K.$$\nLinear differential equations  Definition - Linear differential equation A linear differential equation is a first order differential equation that can be written as\n$$y'+g(x)y = h(x).$$\n  To solve a linear differential equation we try to write the left side of the equation as the derivative of a product. For that we multiply both sides by the function $f(x)$, such that\n$$f'(x)=g(x)f(x).$$\nThus, we get\n$$ \\begin{array}{c} y\u0026rsquo;f(x)+g(x)f(x)y=h(x)f(x)\\newline \\Updownarrow\\newline y\u0026rsquo;f(x)+f'(x)y=h(x)f(x)\\newline \\Updownarrow\\newline \\dfrac{d}{dx}(yf(x))=h(x)f(x) \\end{array} $$\nIntegrating both sides of the previous equation we get the solution\n$$yf(x)=\\int h(x)f(x)\\,dx+C.$$\nOn the other hand, the unique function that satisfies $f'(x)=g(x)f(x)$ is\n$$f(x)=e^{\\int g(x)\\,dx},$$\nso, substituting this function in the previous solution we arrive at the solution of the linear differential equation\n$$ye^{\\int g(x)\\,dx}=\\int h(x) e^{\\int g(x)\\,dx}\\,dx+C,$$\nor what is the same\n Solution of a linear differential equation.\n$$y=e^{-\\int g(x)\\,dx}\\left(\\int h(x)e^{\\int g(x)\\,dx}\\,dx+C\\right).$$\n  Example. If in the differential equation of the Newtonâs law of cooling the temperature of the surrounding medium is a function of time $T_a(t)$, then the differential equation\n$$\\frac{dT}{dt}=k(T-T_a(t)),$$\nis a linear differential equation since it can be written as\n$$T'-kT=-kT_a(t),$$\nwhere the independent term is $-kT_a(t)$ and the coefficient of $T$ is $-k$.\nSubstituting in the formula of the general solution of a linear differential equation we have\n$$y=e^{-\\int -k\\,dt}\\left(\\int -kT_a(t)e^{\\int -k\\,dt}\\,dt+C\\right)= e^{kt}\\left(-\\int kT_a(t)e^{-kt}\\,dt+C\\right).$$\nIn the particular case that $T_a(t)=t$, and the proportionality constant $k=1$, the general solution of the linear differential equation is\n$$y=e^{t}\\left(-\\int te^{-kt}\\,dt+C\\right)=e^t(e^{-t}(t+1)+C)=Ce^t+t+1.$$\nIf, in addition, we know that the temperature of the body at time $t=0$ is $5$ ÂºC, that is, we have the initial condition $T(0)=5$, then we can compute the value of the constant $C$,\n$$y(0)=Ce^0+0+1=5 \\Leftrightarrow C+1=5 \\Leftrightarrow C=4,$$ and we get the particular solution\n$$y(t)=4e^t+t+1.$$\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1600986575,"objectID":"a0eba6affdd1b66e27df2ea84c83aa50","permalink":"/en/teaching/calculus/manual/ordinary-differential-equations/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/en/teaching/calculus/manual/ordinary-differential-equations/","section":"teaching","summary":"Ordinary Differential Equations Often in Physics, Chemistry, Biology, Geometry, etc there arise equations that relate a function with its derivative, or successive derivatives.\n Definition - Ordinary differential equation.

A vector function of a single real variable or vector field of a scalar variable is a function that maps every scalar value $t\\in D\\subseteq \\mathbb{R}$ into a vector $(x_1(t),\\ldots,x_n(t))$ in $\\mathbb{R}^n$:\n$$ \\begin{array}{rccl} f: \u0026amp; \\mathbb{R} \u0026amp; \\longrightarrow \u0026amp; \\mathbb{R}^n\\newline \u0026amp; t \u0026amp; \\longrightarrow \u0026amp; (x_1(t),\\ldots, x_n(t)) \\end{array} $$\nwhere $x_i(t)$, $i=1,\\ldots,n$, are real function of a single real variable known as coordinate functions.\n  The most common vector field of scalar variable are in the the real plane $\\mathbb{R}^2$, where usually they are represented as\n$$f(t)=x(t)\\mathbf{i}+y(t)\\mathbf{j},$$\nand in the real space $\\mathbb{R}^3$, where usually they are represented as\n$$f(t)=x(t)\\mathbf{i}+y(t)\\mathbf{j}+z(t)\\mathbf{k},$$\nGraphic representation of vector fields The graphic representation of a vector field in $\\mathbb{R}^2$ is a trajectory in the real plane.\nThe graphic representation of a vector field in $\\mathbb{R}^3$ is a trajectory in the real space.\nDerivative of a vector field The concept of derivative as the limit of the average rate of change of a function can be extended easily to vector fields.\n Definition - Derivative of a vectorial field.

In such a case, the value of the limit is known as the derivative of the vector field at $a$, and it is written $f'(a)$.\n  Many properties of real functions of a single real variable can be extended to vector fields through its component functions. Thus, for instance, the derivative of a vector field can be computed from the derivatives of its component functions.\n Theorem. Given a vector field $f(t)=(x_1(t),\\ldots,x_n(t))$, if $x_i(t)$ is differentiable at $t=a$ for all $i=1,\\ldots,n$, then $f$ is differentiable at $a$ and its derivative is\n$$f'(a)=(x_1'(a),\\ldots,x_n'(a))$$\n   Proof  The proof for a vectorial field in $\\mathbb{R}^2$ is easy.\n$$\\begin{aligned} f'(a)\u0026amp;=\\lim_{\\Delta t\\rightarrow 0} \\frac{f(a+\\Delta t)-f(a)}{\\Delta t} = \\lim_{\\Delta t\\rightarrow 0} \\frac{(x(a+\\Delta t),y(a+\\Delta t))-(x(a),y(a))}{\\Delta t} =\\newline \u0026amp;= \\lim_{\\Delta t\\rightarrow 0} \\left(\\frac{x(a+\\Delta t)-x(a)}{\\Delta t},\\frac{y(a+\\Delta t)-y(a)}{\\Delta t}\\right) =\\newline \u0026amp;= \\left(\\lim_{\\Delta t\\rightarrow 0}\\frac{x(a+\\Delta t)-x(a)}{\\Delta t},\\lim_{\\Delta t\\rightarrow 0}\\frac{y(a+\\Delta t)-y(a)}{\\Delta t}\\right) = (x'(a),y'(a)). \\end{aligned} $$\n   Kinematics: Curvilinear motion The notion of derivative as a velocity along a trajectory in the real line can be generalized to a trajectory in any euclidean space $\\mathbb{R}^n$.\nIn case of a two dimensional space $\\mathbb{R}^2$, if $f(t)$ describes the position of a moving object in the real plane at any time $t$, taking as reference the coordinates origin $O$ and the unitary vectors ${\\mathbf{i}=(1,0),\\mathbf{j}=(0,1)}$, we can represent the position of the moving object $P$ at every moment $t$ with a vector $\\vec{OP}=x(t)\\mathbf{i}+y(t)\\mathbf{j}$, where the coordinates\n$$ \\begin{cases} x=x(t)\\newline y=y(t) \\end{cases} \\quad t\\in \\mbox{Dom}(f) $$\nare the coordinate functions of $f$.\n In this context the derivative of a trajectory $f'(a)=(x_1'(a),\\ldots,x_n'(a))$ is the velocity vector of the trajectory $f$ at moment $t=a$.   Example. Given the trajectory $f(t) = (\\cos t,\\sin t)$, $t\\in \\mathbb{R}$, whose image is the unit circumference centred in the coordinate origin, its coordinate functions are $x(t) = \\cos t$, $y(t) = \\sin t$, $t\\in \\mathbb{R}$, and its velocity is\n$$\\mathbf{v}=f'(t)=(x'(t),y'(t))=(-\\sin t, \\cos t).$$\nIn the moment $t=\\pi/4$, the object is in position $f(\\pi/4) = (\\cos(\\pi/4),\\sin(\\pi/4)) =(\\sqrt{2}/2,\\sqrt{2}/2)$ and it is moving with a velocity $\\mathbf{v}=f'(\\pi/4)=(-\\sin(\\pi/4),\\cos(\\pi/4))=(-\\sqrt{2}/2,\\sqrt{2}/2)$.\nObserve that the module of the velocity vector is always 1 as $\\vert\\mathbf{v}\\vert=\\sqrt{(-\\sin t)^2+(\\cos t)^2}=1$.\nTangent line to a trajectory Tangent line to a trajectory in the plane Vectorial equation Given a trajectory $f(t)$ in the real plane, the vectors that are parallel to the velocity $\\mathbf{v}$ at a moment $a$ are called tangent vectors to the trajectory $f$ at the moment $a$, and the line passing through $P=f(a)$ directed by $\\mathbf{v}$ is the tangent line to the graph of $f$ at the moment $a$.\n Definition - Tangent line to a trajectory. Given a trajectory $f(t)$ in the real plane $\\mathbb{R}^2$, the tangent line to to the graph of $f$ at $a$ is the line with equation\n$$ \\begin{aligned} l:(x,y) \u0026amp;= f(a)+tf'(a) = (x(a),y(a))+t(x'(a),y'(a))\\newline \u0026amp; = (x(a)+tx'(a),y(a)+ty'(a)). \\end{aligned} $$\n  Example. We have seen that for the trajectory $f(t) = (\\cos t,\\sin t)$, $t\\in \\mathbb{R}$, whose image is the unit circumference centred at the coordinate origin, the object position at the moment $t=\\pi/4$ is $f(\\pi/4)=(\\sqrt{2}/2,\\sqrt{2}/2)$ and its velocity $\\mathbf{v}=(-\\sqrt{2}/2,\\sqrt{2}/2)$. Thus the equation of the tangent line to $f$ at that moment is\n$$ \\begin{aligned} l: (x,y) \u0026amp; = f(\\pi/4)+t\\mathbf{v} = \\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2},\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}\\right)+t\\left(\\frac{-\\sqrt{2}}{2},\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}\\right) =\\newline \u0026amp; =\\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}-t\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2},\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}+t\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}\\right). \\end{aligned} $$\nCartesian and point-slope equations From the vectorial equation of the tangent to a trajectory $f(t)$ at the moment $t=a$ we can get the coordinate functions\n$$ \\begin{cases} x=x(a)+tx'(a)\\newline y=y(a)+ty'(a) \\end{cases} \\quad t\\in \\mathbb{R}, $$\nand solving for $t$ and equalling both equations we get the Cartesian equation of the tangent\n$$\\frac{x-x(a)}{x'(a)}=\\frac{y-y(a)}{y'(a)},$$\nif $x'(a)\\neq 0$ and $y'(a)\\neq 0$.\nFrom this equation it is easy to get the point-slope equation of the tangent\n$$y-y(a)=\\frac{y'(a)}{x'(a)}(x-x(a)).$$\nExample. Using the vectorial equation of the tangent of the previous example\n$$l: (x,y)=\\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}-t\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2},\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}+t\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}\\right),$$\nits Cartesian equation is $$\\frac{x-\\sqrt{2}/2}{-\\sqrt{2}/2} = \\frac{y-\\sqrt{2}/2}{\\sqrt{2}/2}$$ and the point-slope equation is\n$$y-\\sqrt{2}/2 = \\frac{-\\sqrt{2}/2}{\\sqrt{2}/2}(x-\\sqrt{2}/2) \\Rightarrow y=-x+\\sqrt{2}.$$\nNormal line to a trajectory in the plane We have seen that the tangent line to a trajectory $f(t)$ at $a$ is the line passing through the point $P=f(a)$ directed by the velocity vector $\\mathbf{v}=f'(a)=(x'(a),y'(a))$. If we take as direction vector a vector orthogonal to $\\mathbf{v}$, we get another line that is known as normal line to the trajectory.\n Definition - Normal line to a trajectory. Given a trajectory $f(t)$ in the real plane $\\mathbb{R}^2$, the normal line to the graph of $f$ at moment $t=a$ is the line with equation\n$$l: (x,y)=(x(a),y(a))+t(y'(a),-x'(a)) = (x(a)+ty'(a),y(a)-tx'(a)).$$\n  The Cartesian equation is\n$$\\frac{x-x(a)}{y'(a)} = \\frac{y-y(a)}{-x'(a)},$$\nand the point-slope equation is\n$$y-y(a) = \\frac{-x'(a)}{y'(a)}(x-x(a)).$$\n The normal line is always perpendicular to the tangent line as their direction vectors are orthogonal.   Example. Considering again the trajectory of the unit circumference $f(t) = (\\cos t,\\sin t)$, $t\\in \\mathbb{R}$, the normal line to the graph of $f$ at moment $t=\\pi/4$ is\n$$ \\begin{aligned} l: (x,y)\u0026amp;=(\\cos(\\pi/2),\\sin(\\pi/2))+t(\\cos(\\pi/2),\\sin(\\pi/2)) =\\newline \u0026amp;= \\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2},\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}\\right)+t\\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2},\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}\\right) =\\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}+t\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2},\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}+t\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}\\right), \\end{aligned} $$\nthe Cartesian equation is\n$$\\frac{x-\\sqrt{2}/2}{\\sqrt{2}/2} = \\frac{y-\\sqrt{2}/2}{\\sqrt{2}/2},$$ and the point-slope equation is $$y-\\sqrt{2}/2 = \\frac{\\sqrt{2}/2}{\\sqrt{2}/2}(x-\\sqrt{2}/2) \\Rightarrow y=x.$$\nTangent and normal lines to a function A particular case of tangent and normal lines to a trajectory are the tangent and normal lines to a function of one real variable. For every function $y=f(x)$, the trajectory that trace its graph is\n$$g(x) = (x,f(x)) \\quad x\\in \\mathbb{R},$$\nand its velocity is\n$$g'(x) = (1,f'(x)),$$\nso that the tangent line to $g$ at the moment $a$ is\n$$\\frac{x-a}{1} = \\frac{y-f(a)}{f'(a)} \\Rightarrow y-f(a) = f'(a)(x-a),$$\nand the normal line is\n$$\\frac{x-a}{f'(a)} = \\frac{y-f(a)}{-1} \\Rightarrow y-f(a) = \\frac{-1}{f'(a)}(x-a).$$\nExample. Given the function $y=x^2$, the trajectory that traces its graph is $g(x)=(x,x^2)$ and its velocity is $g'(x)=(1,2x)$. At the moment $x=1$ the trajectory passes through the point $(1,1)$ with a velocity $(1,2)$. Thus, the tangent line at that moment is\n$$\\frac{x-1}{1} = \\frac{y-1}{2} \\Rightarrow y-1 = 2(x-1) \\Rightarrow y = 2x-1,$$\nand the normal line is\n$$\\frac{x-1}{2} = \\frac{y-1}{-1} \\Rightarrow y-1 = \\frac{-1}{2}(x-1) \\Rightarrow y = \\frac{-x}{2}+\\frac{3}{2}.$$\nTangent line to a trajectory in the space The concept of tangent line to a trajectory can be easily extended from the real plane to the three-dimensional space $\\mathbb{R}^3$.\nIf $f(t)=(x(t),y(t),z(t))$, $t\\in \\mathbb{R}$, is a trajectory in the real space $\\mathbb{R}^3$, then at the moment $a$, the moving object that follows this trajectory will be at the position $P=(x(a),y(a),z(a))$ with a velocity $\\mathbf{v}=f'(t)=(x'(t),y'(t),z'(t))$. Thus, the tangent line to $f$ at this moment have the following vectorial equation\n$$ \\begin{aligned} l\u0026amp;: (x,y,z)=(x(a),y(a),z(a))+t(x'(a),y'(a),z'(a)) =\\newline \u0026amp;= (x(a)+tx'(a),y(a)+ty'(a),z(a)+tz'(a)), \\end{aligned} $$\nand the Cartesian equations are $$\\frac{x-x(a)}{x'(a)}=\\frac{y-y(a)}{y'(a)}=\\frac{z-z(a)}{z'(a)},$$ provided that $x'(a)\\neq 0$, $y'(a)\\neq 0$ y $z'(a)\\neq 0$.\nExample. Given the trajectory $f(t)=(\\cos t, \\sin t, t)$, $t\\in \\mathbb{R}$ in the real space, at the moment $t=\\pi/2$ the trajectory passes through the point\n$$f(\\pi/2)=(\\cos(\\pi/2),\\sin(\\pi/2),\\pi/2)=(0,1,\\pi/2),$$\nwith velocity\n$$\\mathbf{v}=f'(\\pi/2)=(-\\sin(\\pi/2),\\cos(\\pi/2), 1)=(-1,0,1),$$\nand the tangent line to the graph of $f$ at that moment is\n$$l:(x,y,z)=(0,1,\\pi/2)+t(-1,0,1) = (-t,1,t+\\pi/2).$$\nInteractive Example\nNormal plane to a trajectory in the space In the three-dimensional space $\\mathbb{R}^3$, the normal line to a trajectory is not unique. There are an infinite number of normal lines and all of them are in the normal plane.\nIf $f(t)=(x(t),y(t),z(t))$, $t\\in \\mathbb{R}$, is a trajectory in the real space $\\mathbb{R}^3$, then at the moment $a$, the moving object that follows this trajectory will be at the position $P=(x(a),y(a),z(a))$ with a velocity $\\mathbf{v}=f'(t)=(x'(t),y'(t),z'(t))$. Thus, using the velocity vector as normal vector the normal plane to $f$ at this moment have the following vectorial equation\n$$ \\begin{aligned} \\Pi \u0026amp;: (x-x(a),y-y(a),z-z(a))(x'(a),y'(a),z'(a)) = 0\\newline \u0026amp;= x'(a)(x-x(a))+y'(a)(y-y(a))+z'(a)(z-z(a))=0. \\end{aligned} $$\nExample. For the trajectory of the previous example $f(t)=(\\cos t, \\sin t, t)$, $t\\in \\mathbb{R}$, at the moment $t=\\pi/2$ the trajectory passes through the point\n$$f(\\pi/2)=(\\cos(\\pi/2),\\sin(\\pi/2),\\pi/2)=(0,1,\\pi/2),$$\nwith velocity\n$$\\mathbf{v}=f'(\\pi/2)=(-\\sin(\\pi/2),\\cos(\\pi/2), 1)=(-1,0,1),$$ and normal plane to the graph of $f$ at that moment is\n$$\\Pi:\\left(x-0,y-1,z-\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right)(-1,0,1) =0 \\Leftrightarrow -x+z-\\frac{\\pi}{2}=0.$$\nInteractive Example\nFunctions of several variables A lot of problems in Geometry, Physics, Chemistry, Biology, etc. involve a variable that depend on two or more variables:\n The area of a triangle depends on two variables that are the base and height lengths. The volume of a perfect gas depends on two variables that are the pressure and the temperature. The way travelled by an object free falling depends on a lot of variables: the time, the area of the cross section of the object, the latitude and longitude of the object, the height above the sea level, the air pressure, the air temperature, the speed of wind, etc.  These dependencies are expressed with functions of several variables.\n Definition - Functions of several real variables. A function of $n$ real variables or a scalar field from a set $A_1\\times \\cdots \\times A_n\\subseteq \\mathbb{R}^n$ in a set $B\\subseteq \\mathbb{R}$, is a relation that maps any tuple $(a_1,\\ldots,a_n)\\in A_1\\times \\cdots\\times A_n$ into a unique element of $B$, denoted by $f(a_1,\\ldots,a_n)$, that is knwon as the image of $(a_1,\\ldots,a_n)$ by $f$.\n$$ \\begin{array}{lccc} f: \u0026amp; A_1\\times\\cdots\\times A_n \u0026amp; \\longrightarrow \u0026amp; B\\newline \u0026amp;(a_1,\\ldots,a_n) \u0026amp; \\longrightarrow \u0026amp; f(a_1,\\ldots,a_n) \\end{array} $$\n   The area of a triangle is a real function of two real variables  $$f(x,y)=\\frac{xy}{2}.$$\n The volume of a perfect gas is a real function of two real variables  $$v=f(t,p)=\\frac{nRt}{p},\\quad \\mbox{with $n$ and $R$ constants.}$$\nGraph of a function of two variables The graph of a function of two variables $f(x,y)$ is a surface in the real space $\\mathbb{R}^3$ where every point of the surface has coordinates $(x,y,z)$, with $z=f(x,y)$.\nExample. The function $f(x,y)=\\dfrac{xy}{2}$ that measures the area of a triangle of base $x$ and height $y$ has the graph below.\nThe function $\\displaystyle f(x,y)=\\frac{\\sin(x^2+y^2)}{\\sqrt{x^2+y^2}}$ has the peculiar graph below.\nLevel set of a scalar field  Definition - Level set Given a scalar field $f:\\mathbb{R}^n\\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$, the level set $c$ of $f$ is the set\n$$C_{f,c}={(x_1,\\ldots,x_n): f(x_1,\\ldots,x_n)=c},$$\nthat is, a set where the function takes on the constant value $c$.\n  Example. Given the scalar field $f(x,y)=x^2+y^2$ and the point $P=(1,1)$, the level set of $f$ that includes $P$ is\n$$C_{f,2} = {(x,y): f(x,y)=f(1,1)=2} = {(x,y): x^2+y^2=2},$$\nthat is the circumference of radius $\\sqrt{2}$ centred at the origin.\nLevel sets are common in applications like topographic maps, where the level curves correspond to points with the same height above the sea level,\nand weather maps (isobars), where level curves correspond to points with the same atmospheric pressure.\nPartial functions  Definition - Partial function. Given a scalar field $f:\\mathbb{R}^n\\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$, an $i$-th partial function of $f$ is any function $f_i:\\mathbb{R}\\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$ that results of substituting all the variables of $f$ by constants, except the $i$-th variable, that is:\n$$f_i(x)=f(c_1,\\ldots,c_{i-1},x,c_{i+1},\\ldots,c_{n}),$$\nwith $c_j$ $(j=1,\\ldots, n,\\ j\\neq i)$ constants.\n  Example. If we take the function that measures the area of a triangle\n$$f(x,y)=\\frac{xy}{2},$$ and set the value of the base to $x=c$, then we the area of the triangle depends only of the height, and $f$ becomes a function of one variable, that is the partial function\n$$f_1(y)=f(c,y)=\\frac{cy}{2},\\quad \\mbox{with $c$ constant}.$$\nPartial derivative notion Variation of a function with respect to a variable We can measure the variation of a scalar field with respect to each of its variables in the same way that we measured the variation of a one-variable function.\nLet $z=f(x,y)$ be a scalar field of $\\mathbb{R}^2$. If we are at point $(x_0,y_0)$ and we increase the value of $x$ a quantity $\\Delta x$, then we move in the direction of the $x$-axis from the point $(x_0,y_0)$ to the point $(x_0+\\Delta x,y_0)$, and the variation of the function is $$\\Delta z=f(x_0+\\Delta x,y_0)-f (x_0,y_0).$$\nThus, the rate of change of the function with respect to $x$ along the interval $[x_0,x_0+\\Delta x]$ is given by the quotient\n$$\\frac{\\Delta z}{\\Delta x}=\\frac{f(x_0+\\Delta x,y_0)-f(x_0,y_0)}{\\Delta x}.$$\nInstantaneous rate of change of a scalar field with respect to a variable If instead o measuring the rate of change in an interval, we measure the rate of change in a point, that is, when $\\Delta x$ approaches 0, then we get the instantaneous rate of change that is the partial derivative with respect to $x$.\n$$\\lim_{\\Delta x\\rightarrow 0}\\frac{\\Delta z}{\\Delta x}=\\lim_{\\Delta x \\rightarrow 0}\\frac{f(x_0+\\Delta x,y_0)-f(x_0,y_0)}{\\Delta x}.$$\nThe value of this limit, if exists, it is known as the partial derivative of $f$ with respect to the variable $x$ at the point $(x_0,y_0)$; it is written as $$\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x}(x_0,y_0).$$\nThis partial derivative measures the instantaneous rate of change of $f$ at the point $P=(x_0,y_0)$ when $P$ moves in the $x$-axis direction.\nGeometric interpretation of partial derivatives Geometrically, a two-variable function $z=f(x,y)$ defines a surface. If we cut this surface with a plane of equation $y=y_0$ (that is, the plane where $y$ is the constant $y_0$) the intersection is a curve, and the partial derivative of $f$ with respect to to $x$ at $(x_0,y_0)$ is the slope of the tangent line to that curve at $x=x_0$.\nInteractive Example\nPartial derivative The concept of partial derivative can be extended easily from two-variable function to $n$-variables functions.\n Definition - Partial derivative. Given a $n$-variables function $f(x_1,\\ldots,x_n)$, $f$ is partially differentiable with respect to the variable $x_i$ at the point $a=(a_1,\\ldots,a_n)$ if exists the limit\n$$\\lim_{\\Delta x_i\\rightarrow 0} \\frac{f(a_1,\\ldots,a_{i-1},a_i+\\Delta x_i,a_{i+1},\\ldots,a_n)-f(a_1,\\ldots,a_{i-1},a_i,a_{i+1},\\ldots,a_n)} {h}.$$\nIn such a case, the value of the limit is known as partial derivative of $f$ with respect to $x_i$ at $a$; it is denoted\n$$f'_{x_i}(a)=\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x_i}(a).$$\n  Remark. The definition of derivative for one-variable functions is a particular case of this definition for $n=1$.\nPartial derivatives computation When we measure the variation of $f$ with respect to a variable $x_i$ at the point $a=(a_1,\\ldots,a_n)$, the other variables remain constant. Thus, if we can consider the $i$-th partial function $$f_i(x_i)=f(a_1,\\ldots,a_{i-1},x_i,a_{i+1},\\ldots,a_n),$$\nthe partial derivative of $f$ with respect to $x_i$ can be computed differentiating this function:\n$$\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x_i}(a)=f_i'(a_i).$$\n To differentiate partially $f(x_1,\\ldots,x_n)$ with respect to the variable $x_i$, you have to differentiate $f$ as a function of the variable $x_i$, considering the other variables as constants.   Example of a perfect gas. Consider the function that measures the volume of a perfect gas $$v(t,p)=\\frac{nRt}{p},$$ where $t$ is the temperature, $p$ the pressure and $n$ and $R$ are constants.\nThe instantaneous rate of change of the volume with respect to the pressure is the partial derivative of $v$ with respect to $p$. To compute this derivative we have to think in $t$ as a constant and differentiate $v$ as if the unique variable was $p$:\n$$\\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial p}(t,p)=\\frac{d}{dp}\\left(\\frac{nRt}{p}\\right)_{\\mbox{$t=$cst}}=\\frac{-nRt}{p^2}.$$\nIn the same way, the instantaneous rate of change of the volume with respect to the temperature is the partial derivative of $v$ with respect to $t$:\n$$\\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial t}(t,p)=\\frac{d}{dt}\\left(\\frac{nRt}{p}\\right)_{\\mbox{$p=$cst}}=\\frac{nR}{p}.$$\nGradient  Definition - Gradient. Given a scalar field $f(x_1,\\ldots,x_n)$, the gradient of $f$, denoted by $\\nabla f$, is a function that maps every point $a=(a_1,\\ldots,a_n)$ to a vector with coordinates the partial derivatives of $f$ at $a$,\n$$\\nabla f(a)=\\left(\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x_1}(a),\\ldots,\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x_n}(a)\\right).$$\n   Later we will show that the gradient in a point is a vector with the magnitude and direction of the maximum rate of change of the function in that point. Thus, $\\nabla f(a)$ points to direction of maximum increase of $f$ at $a$, while $-\\nabla f(a)$ points to the direction of maximum decrease of $f$ at $a$.   Example. After heating a surface, the temperature $t$ (in $^\\circ$C) at each point $(x,y,z)$ (in m) of the surface is given by the function\n$$t(x,y,z)=\\frac{x}{y}+z^2.$$\nIn what direction will increase the temperature faster at point $(2,1,1)$ of the surface? What magnitude will the maximum increase of temperature have?\nThe direction of maximum increase of the temperature is given by the gradient\n$$\\nabla t(x,y,z)=\\left(\\frac{\\partial t}{\\partial x}(x,y,z),\\frac{\\partial t}{\\partial y}(x,y,z),\\frac{\\partial t}{\\partial z}(x,y,z)\\right)=\\left(\\frac{1}{y},\\frac{-x}{y^2},2z\\right).$$\nAt point $(2,1,1)$ de direction is given by the vector\n$$\\nabla t(2,1,1)=\\left(\\frac{1}{1},\\frac{-2}{1^2},2\\cdot 1\\right)=(1,-2,2),$$\nand its magnitude is\n$$|\\nabla f(2,1,1)|=|\\sqrt{1^2+(-2)^2+2^2}|=|\\sqrt{9}|=3 \\mbox{ $^\\circ$C/m}.$$\nComposition of a vectorial field with a scalar field Multivariate chain rule If $f:\\mathbb{R}^n\\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$ is a scalar field and $g:\\mathbb{R}\\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}^n$ is a vectorial function, then it is possible to compound $g$ with $f$, so that $f\\circ g:\\mathbb{R}\\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$ is a one-variable function.\n Theorem - Chain rule. If $g(t)=(x_1(t),\\ldots,x_n(t))$ is a vectorial function differentiable at $t$ and $f(x_1,\\ldots,x_n)$ is a scalar field differentiable at the point $g(t)$, then $f\\circ g(t)$ is differentiable at $t$ and\n$$(f\\circ g)'(t) = \\nabla f(g(t))\\cdot g'(t)=\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x_1}\\frac{dx_1}{dt}+ \\cdots + \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x_n}\\frac{dx_n}{dt}$$\n  Example. Let us consider the scalar field $f(x,y)=x^2y$ and the vectorial function $g(t)=(\\cos t,\\sin t)$ $t\\in [0,2\\pi]$ in the real plane, then\n$$\\nabla f(x,y) = (2xy, x^2) \\quad \\mbox{and} \\quad g'(t) = (-\\sin t, \\cos t),$$\nand\n$$ \\begin{aligned} (f\\circ g)'(t) \u0026amp;= \\nabla f(g(t))\\cdot g'(t) = (2\\cos t\\sin t,\\cos^2 t)\\cdot (-\\sin t,\\cos t) =\\newline \u0026amp;= -2\\cos t\\sin^2 t+\\cos^3 t. \\end{aligned} $$\nWe can get the same result differentiating the composed function directly\n$$(f\\circ g)(t) = f(g(t)) = f(\\cos t, \\sin t) = \\cos^2 t\\sin t,$$\nand its derivative is\n$$(f\\circ g)'(t) = 2\\cos t(-\\sin t)\\sin t+\\cos^2 t \\cos t = -2\\cos t\\sin^2 t+\\cos^3 t.$$\nThe chain rule for the composition of a vectorial function with a scalar field allow us to get the algebra of derivatives for one-variable functions easily:\n$$ \\begin{aligned} (u+v)' \u0026amp;= u'+v'\\newline (uv)' \u0026amp;= u\u0026rsquo;v+uv'\\newline \\left(\\frac{u}{v}\\right)' \u0026amp;= \\frac{u\u0026rsquo;v-uv'}{v^2}\\newline (u\\circ v)' \u0026amp;= u'(v)v' \\end{aligned} $$\nTo infer the derivative of the sum of two functions $u$ and $v$, we can take the scalar field $f(x,y)=x+y$ and the vectorial function $g(t)=(u(t),v(t))$.

If $\\mathbf{v}$ is the velocity at $P$ of a trajectory following $C$, then\n$$\\nabla f(P) \\cdot \\mathbf{v} = 0.$$\n   Proof  If we take the trajectory $g(t)$ that follows the level set $C$ and passes through $P$ at time $t=t_0$, that is $P=g(t_0)$, so $\\mathbf{v}=g'(t_0)$, then\n$$(f\\circ g)(t) = f(g(t)) = f(P),$$\nthat is constant at any $t$. Thus, applying the chain rule we have\n$$(f\\circ g)'(t) = \\nabla f(g(t))\\cdot g'(t) = 0,$$\nand, particularly, at $t=t_0$, we have\n$$\\nabla f(P)\\cdot \\mathbf{v} = 0.$$\n   That means that the gradient of $f$ at $P$ is normal to $C$ at $P$, provided that the gradient is not zero.\nNormal and tangent line to curve in the plane  Normal line to a curve in the plane. According to the previous result, the normal line to a curve with equation $f(x,y)=0$ at point $P=(x_0,y_0)$, has equation\n$$P+t\\nabla f(P) = (x_0,y_0)+t\\nabla f(x_0,y_0).$$\n  Example. Given the scalar field $f(x,y)=x^2+y^2-25$, and the point $P=(3,4)$, the level set of $f$ that passes through $P$, that satisfies $f(x,y)=f(P)=0$, is the circle with radius 5 centred at the origin of coordinates. Thus, taking as a normal vector the gradient of $f$\n$$\\nabla f(x,y) = (2x,2y),$$\nat the point $P=(3,4)$ is $\\nabla f(3,4) = (6,8)$, and the normal line to the circle at $P$ is\n$$P+t\\nabla f(P) = (3,4)+t(6,8) = (3+6t,4+8t),$$\nOn the other hand, the tangent line to the circle at $P$ is\n$$((x,y)-P)\\cdot \\nabla f(P) = ((x,y)-(3,4))\\cdot (6,8) = (x-3,y-4)\\cdot(6,8) = 6x+8y=50.$$\nNormal line and tangent plane to a surface in the space  Normal line to a surface in the space. if we have a surface with equation $f(x,y,z)=0$, at the point $P=(x_0,y_0,z_0)$ the normal line has equation\n$$P+t\\nabla f(P) = (x_0,y_0,z_0)+t\\nabla f(x_0,y_0,z_0).$$\n  Example. Given the scalar field $f(x,y,z)=x^2+y^2-z$, and the point $P=(1,1,2)$, the level set of $f$ that passes through $P$, that satisfies $f(x,y)=f(P)=0$, is the paraboloid $z=x^2+y^2$. Thus, taking as a normal vector the gradient of $f$\n$$\\nabla f(x,y,z) = (2x,2y,-1),$$\nat the point $P=(1,1,2)$ is $\\nabla f(1,1,2) = (2,2,-1)$, and the normal line to the paraboloid at $P$ is\n$$ \\begin{aligned} P+t\\nabla f(P)\u0026amp;= (1,1,2)+t\\nabla f(1,1,2) = (1,1,2)+t(2,2,-1)\\newline \u0026amp;= (1+2t,1+2t,2-t). \\end{aligned} $$\nOn the other hand, the tangent plane to the paraboloid at $P$ is\n$$\\begin{aligned} ((x,y,z)-P)\\cdot \\nabla f(P) \u0026amp;= ((x,y,z)-(1,1,2))(2,2,-1) = (x-1,y-1,z-2)(2,2,-1)=\\newline \u0026amp;= 2(x-1)+2(y-1)-(z-2) = 2x+2y-z-2= 0. \\end{aligned}$$\nThe graph of the paraboloid $f(x,y,z)=x^2+y^2-z=0$ and the normal line and the tangent plane to the graph of $f$ at the point $P=(1,1,2)$ are below.\nInteractive Example\nDirectional derivative For a scalar field $f(x,y)$, we have seen that the partial derivative $\\dfrac{\\partial f}{\\partial x}(x_0,y_0)$ is the instantaneous rate of change of $f$ with respect to $x$ at point $P=(x_0,y_0)$, that is, when we move along the $x$-axis.\nIn the same way, $\\dfrac{\\partial f}{\\partial y}(x_0,y_0)$ is the instantaneous rate of change of $f$ with respect to $y$ at the point $P=(x_0,y_0)$, that is, when we move along the $y$-axis.\nBut, what happens if we move along any other direction?\nThe instantaneous rate of change of $f$ at the point $P=(x_0,y_0)$ along the direction of a unitary vector $u$ is known as directional derivative.\n Definition - Directional derivative. Given a scalar field $f$ of $\\mathbb{R}^n$, a point $P$ and a unitary vector $\\mathbf{u}$ in that space, we say that $f$ is differentiable at $P$ along the direction of $\\mathbf{u}$ if exists the limit\n$$f^\\prime_{\\mathbf{u}}(P) = \\lim_{h\\rightarrow 0}\\frac{f(P+h\\mathbf{u})-f(P)}{h}.$$\nIn such a case, the value of the limit is known as directional derivative of $f$ at the point $P$ along the direction of $\\mathbf{u}$.\n   Theorem - Directional derivative . Given a scalar field $f$ of $\\mathbb{R}^n$, a point $P$ and a unitary vector $\\mathbf{u}$ in that space, the directional derivative of $f$ at the point $P$ along the direction of $\\mathbf{u}$ can be computed as the dot product of the gradient of $f$ at $P$ and the unitary vector $\\mathbf{u}$:\n$$f^\\prime_{\\mathbf{u}}(P) = \\nabla f(P)\\cdot \\mathbf{u}.$$\n   Proof  If we consider a unitary vector $\\mathbf{u}$, the trajectory that passes through $P$, following the direction of $\\mathbf{u}$, has equation\n$$g(t)=P+t\\mathbf{u},\\ t\\in\\mathbb{R}.$$\nFor $t=0$, this trajectory passes through the point $P=g(0)$ with velocity $\\mathbf{u}=g'(0)$.\nThus, the directional derivative of $f$ at the point $P$ along the direction of $\\mathbf{u}$ is\n$$(f\\circ g)'(0) = \\nabla f(g(0))\\cdot g'(0) = \\nabla f(P)\\cdot \\mathbf{u}.$$\n    The partial derivatives are the directional derivatives along the vectors of the canonical basis.   Example. Given the function $f(x,y) = x^2+y^2$, its gradient is\n$$\\nabla f(x,y) = (2x,2y).$$\nThe directional derivative of $f$ at the point $P=(1,1)$, along the unit vector $\\mathbf{u}=(1/\\sqrt{2},1/\\sqrt{2})$ is\n$$f_{\\mathbf{u}}'(P) = \\nabla f(P)\\cdot \\mathbf{u} = (2,2)\\cdot(1/\\sqrt{2},1/\\sqrt{2}) = \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{2}}+\\frac{2}{\\sqrt{2}} = \\frac{4}{\\sqrt{2}}.$$\nTo compute the directional derivative along a non-unitary vector $\\mathbf{v}$, we have to use the unitary vector that results from normalizing $v$ with the transformation\n$$\\mathbf{v'}=\\frac{\\mathbf{v}}{|\\mathbf{v}|}.$$\nGeometric interpretation of the directional derivative Geometrically, a two-variable function $z=f(x,y)$ defines a surface. If we cut this surface with a plane of equation $a(y-y_0)=b(x-x_0)$ (that is, the vertical plane that passes through the point $P=(x_0,y_0)$ with the direction of vector $\\mathbf{u}=(a,b)$) the intersection is a curve, and the directional derivative of $f$ at $P$ along the direction of $\\mathbf{u}$ is the slope of the tangent line to that curve at point $P$.\nInteractive Example\nGrowth of scalar field along the gradient We have seen that for any vector $\\mathbf{u}$\n$$f^\\prime_{\\mathbf{u}}(P) = \\nabla f(P)\\cdot \\mathbf{u} = |\\nabla f(P)|\\cos \\theta,$$\nwhere $\\theta$ is the angle between $\\mathbf{u}$ and the gradient $\\nabla f(P)$.\nTaking into account that $-1\\leq \\cos\\theta\\leq 1$, for any vector $\\mathbf{u}$ it is satisfied that\n$$-|\\nabla f(P)|\\leq f'_{\\mathbf{u}}(P)\\leq |\\nabla f(P)| .$$\nFurthermore, if $\\mathbf{u}$ has the same direction and sense than the gradient, we have $f'_{\\mathbf{u}}(P)=\\vert\\nabla f(P)\\vert\\cos 0=\\vert\\nabla f(P)\\vert$. Therefore, the maximum increase of a scalar field at a point $P$ is along the direction of the gradient at that point.\nIn the same manner, if $\\mathbf{u}$ has the same direction but opposite sense than the gradient, we have $f_{\\mathbf{u}}'(P)=\\vert\\nabla f(P)\\vert\\cos \\pi=-\\vert\\nabla f(P)\\vert$. Therefore, the maximum decrease of a scalar field at a point $P$ is along the opposite direction of the gradient at that point.\nImplicit derivation When we have a relation $f(x,y)=0$, sometimes we can consider $y$ as an implicit function of $x$, at least in a neighbourhood of a point $(x_0,y_0)$.\nThe equation $x^2+y^2=25$, whose graph is the circle of radius 5 centred at the origin of coordinates, its not a function, because if we solve the equation for $y$, we have two images for some values of $x$,\n$$y=\\pm \\sqrt{25-x^2}$$\nHowever, near the point $(3,4)$ we can represent the relation as the function $y=\\sqrt{25-x^2}$, and near the point $(3,-4)$ we can represent the relation as the function $y=-\\sqrt{25-x^2}$.\nIf an equation $f(x,y)=0$ defines $y$ as a implicit function of $x$, $y=h(x)$, in a neighbourhood of $(x_0,y_0)$, then we can compute de derivative of $y$, $h'(x)$, even if we do not know the explicit formula for $h$.\n Theorem - Implicit derivation. Let $f(x,y):\\mathbb{R}^2\\longrightarrow \\mathbb{R}$ a two-variable function and let $(x_0,y_0)$ be a point in $\\mathbb{R}^2$ such that $f(x_0,y_0)=0$. If $f$ has partial derivatives continuous at $(x_0,y_0)$ and $\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y}(x_0,y_0)\\neq 0$, then there is an open interval $I\\subset \\mathbb{R}$ with $x_0\\in I$ and a function $h(x): I\\longrightarrow \\mathbb{R}$ such that\n $y_0=h(x_0)$. $f(x,h(x))=0$ for all $x\\in I$. $h$ is differentiable on $I$, and $y'=h'(x)=\\frac{-\\dfrac{\\partial f}{\\partial x}}{\\dfrac{\\partial f}{\\partial y}}$    Proof. To prove the last result, take the trajectory $g(x)=(x,h(x))$ on the interval $I$. Then\n$$(f\\circ g)(x) = f(g(x)) = f(x,h(x))=0.$$\nThus, using the chain rule we have\n$$ \\begin{aligned} (f\\circ g)'(x) \u0026amp;= \\nabla f(g(x))\\cdot g'(x) = \\left(\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x}, \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y}\\right)\\cdot (1,h'(x)) = \\newline \u0026amp;= \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x}+\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y}h'(x) = 0, \\end{aligned} $$\nfrom where we can deduce\n$$y'=h'(x)=\\frac{-\\dfrac{\\partial f}{\\partial x}}{\\dfrac{\\partial f}{\\partial y}}.$$\nThis technique that allows us to compute $y'$ in a neighbourhood of $x_0$ without the explicit formula of $y=h(x)$, it is known as implicit derivation.\nExample. Consider the equation of the circle of radius 5 centred at the origin $x^2+y^2=25$. It can also be written as\n$$f(x,y) = x^2+y^2-25 = 0.$$ Take the point $(3,4)$ that satisfies the equation, $f(3,4)=0$.\nAs $f$ have partial derivatives $\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x}=2x$ and $\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y}=2y$, that are continuous at $(3,4)$, and $\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y}(3,4)=8\\neq 0$, then $y$ can be expressed as a function of $x$ in a neighbourhood of $(3,4)$ and its derivative is\n$$y'=\\frac{-\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x}}{\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y}} = \\frac{-2x}{2y}=\\frac{-x}{y} \\quad \\mbox{and} \\quad y'(3)=\\frac{-3}{4}.$$\nIn this particular case, that we know the explicit formula of $y=\\sqrt{1-x^2}$, we can get the same result computing the derivative as usual\n$$y' = \\frac{1}{2\\sqrt{1-x^2}}(-2x) = \\frac{-x}{\\sqrt{1-x^2}}.$$\nThe implicit function theorem can be generalized to functions with several variables.\n Theorem - Implicit derivation. Let $f(x_1,\\ldots,x_n,y):\\mathbb{R}^{n+1}\\longrightarrow \\mathbb{R}$ a $n+1$-variables function and let $(a_1,\\ldots, a_n,b)$ be a point in $\\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$ such that $f(a_1,\\ldots,a_n,b)=0$. If $f$ has partial derivatives continuous at $(a_1,\\ldots,a_n,b)$ and $\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y}(a_1,\\ldots,a_n,b)\\neq 0$, then there is a region $I\\subset \\mathbb{R}^n$ with $(x_1,\\ldots,x_n)\\in I$ and a function $h(x_1,\\ldots, x_n): I\\longrightarrow \\mathbb{R}$ such that\n $b=h(a_1,\\ldots,a_n)$. $f(x_1,\\ldots,x_n,h(x_1,\\ldots,x_n))=0$ for all $(x_1,\\ldots,x_n)\\in I$. $h$ is differentiable on $I$, and $\\dfrac{\\partial y}{\\partial x_i}=\\frac{-\\dfrac{\\partial f}{\\partial x_i}}{\\dfrac{\\partial f}{\\partial y}}$    Second order partial derivatives As the partial derivatives of a function are also functions of several variables we can differentiate partially each of them.\nIf a function $f(x_1,\\ldots,x_n)$ has a partial derivative $f^\\prime_{x_i}(x_1,\\ldots,x_n)$ with respect to the variable $x_i$ in a set $A$, then we can differentiate partially again $f_{x_i}^\\prime$ with respect to the variable $x_j$. This second derivative, when exists, is known as second order partial derivative of $f$ with respect to the variables $x_i$ and $x_j$; it is written as\n$$\\frac{\\partial ^2 f}{\\partial x_j \\partial x_i}= \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x_j}\\left(\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x_i}\\right).$$\nIn the same way we can define higher order partial derivatives.\nExample.

Linear approximation of a two-variable function If $f$ is a scalar field of two variables $f(x,y)$ and $P=(x_0,y_0)$, as for any point $Q=(x,y)$ we can take the vector $\\mathbf{v}=\\vec{PQ}=(x-x_0,y-y_0)$, then the first degree Taylor polynomial of $f$ at $P$, can be written as\n$$ \\begin{aligned} P^1_{f,P}(x,y) \u0026amp;= f(x_0,y_0)+\\nabla f(x_0,y_0)(x-x_0,y-y_0) =\\newline \u0026amp;= f(x_0,y_0)+\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x}(x_0,y_0)(x-x_0)+\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y}(x_0,y_0)(y-y_0). \\end{aligned} $$\nExample. Given the scalar field $f(x,y)=\\log(xy)$, its gradient is\n$$\\nabla f(x,y) = \\left(\\frac{1}{x},\\frac{1}{y}\\right),$$\nand the first degree Taylor polynomial at the point $P=(1,1)$ is\n$$\\begin{aligned} P^1_{f,P}(x,y) \u0026amp;= f(1,1) +\\nabla f(1,1)\\cdot (x-1,y-1) = \\newline \u0026amp;= \\log 1+(1,1)\\cdot(x-1,y-1) = x-1+y-1 = x+y-2. \\end{aligned}$$\nThis polynomial approximates $f$ near the point $P$. For instance,\n$$f(1.01,1.01) \\approx P^1_{f,P}(1.01,1.01) = 1.01+1.01-2 = 0.02.$$\nThe graph of the scalar field $f(x,y)=\\log(xy)$ and the first degree Taylor polynomial of $f$ at the point $P=(1,1)$ is below.\nQuadratic approximation of a scalar field If $P$ is a point in the domain of a scalar field $f$ and $\\mathbf{v}$ is a vector, the second degree Taylor formula of $f$ around $P$ is\n$$f(P+\\mathbf{v}) = f(P) + \\nabla f(P)\\cdot \\mathbf{v} + \\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\mathbf{v}\\nabla^2f(P)\\mathbf{v}\\right) + R^2_{f,P}(\\mathbf{v}),$$\nwhere\n$$P^2_{f,P}(\\mathbf{v})f(P)+\\nabla f(P)\\mathbf{v}+\\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\mathbf{v}\\nabla^2f(P)\\mathbf{v}\\right)$$\nis the second degree Taylor polynomial of $f$ at the point $P$, and $R^2_{f,P}(\\mathbf{v})$ is the Taylor remainder for the vector $\\mathbf{v}$, that is the error in the approximation.\nThe remainder satisfies\n$$\\lim_{|\\mathbf{v}\\rightarrow 0|} \\frac{R^2_{f,P}(\\mathbf{v})}{|\\mathbf{v}|^2} = 0.$$\nThis means that the remainder is smaller than the square of the module of $\\mathbf{v}$.\nQuadratic approximation of a two-variable function If $f$ is a scalar field of two variables $f(x,y)$ and $P=(x_0,y_0)$, then the second degree Taylor polynomial of $f$ at $P$, can be written as\n$$ \\begin{aligned} P^2_{f,P}(x,y) \u0026amp;= f(x_0,y_0)+\\nabla f(x_0,y_0)(x-x_0,y-y_0) + \\newline \u0026amp; + \\frac{1}{2}(x-x_0,y-y_0)\\nabla^2f(x_0,y_0)(x-x_0,y-y_0)= \\newline \u0026amp; = f(x_0,y_0)+\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x}(x_0,y_0)(x-x_0)+\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y}(x_0,y_0)(y-y_0)+ \\newline \u0026amp; + \\frac{1}{2}(\\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial x^2}(x_0,y_0) (x-x_0)^2 + 2\\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial y\\partial x}(x_0,y_0)(x-x_0)(y-y_0) + \\newline \u0026amp; + \\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial y^2}(x_0,y_0)(y-y_0^2)) \\end{aligned} $$\nExample. Given the scalar field $f(x,y)=\\log(xy)$, its gradient is\n$$\\nabla f(x,y) = \\left(\\frac{1}{x},\\frac{1}{y}\\right),$$\nits Hessian matrix is\n$$Hf(x,y) = \\left( \\begin{array}{cc} \\frac{-1}{x^2} \u0026amp; 0\\newline 0 \u0026amp; \\frac{-1}{y^2} \\end{array} \\right)$$\nand the second degree Taylor polynomial of $f$ at the point $P=(1,1)$ is\n$$\\begin{aligned} P^2_{f,P}(x,y) \u0026amp;= f(1,1) +\\nabla f(1,1)\\cdot (x-1,y-1) +\\newline \u0026amp;+ \\frac{1}{2}(x-1,y-1)\\nabla^2f(1,1)\\cdot(x-1,y-1)=\\newline \u0026amp;= \\log 1+(1,1)\\cdot(x-1,y-1) +\\newline \u0026amp;+ \\frac{1}{2}(x-1,y-1) \\left( \\begin{array}{cc} -1 \u0026amp; 0\\newline 0 \u0026amp; -1 \\end{array} \\right) \\left( \\begin{array}{c} x-1\\newline y-1 \\end{array} \\right) = \\newline \u0026amp;= x-1+y-1+\\frac{-x^2-y^2+2x+2y-2}{2} =\\newline \u0026amp;= \\frac{-x^2-y^2+4x+4y-6}{2}. \\end{aligned}$$\nThus, $$ \\begin{aligned} f(1.01,1.01) \\approx P^1_{f,P}(1.01,1.01) \u0026amp;= \\frac{-1.01^2-1.01^2+4\\cdot 1.01+4\\cdot 1.01-6}{2} \\newline \u0026amp;= 0.0199. \\end{aligned} $$\nThe graph of the scalar field $f(x,y)=\\log(xy)$ and the second degree Taylor polynomial of $f$ at the point $P=(1,1)$ is below.\nInteractive Example\nRelative extrema  Definition - Relative extrema. A scalar field $f$ in $\\mathbb{R}^n$ has a relative maximum at a point $P$ if there is a value $\\epsilon\u0026gt;0$ such that\n$$f(P)\\geq f(X)\\ \\forall X, |\\vec{PX}|\u0026lt;\\epsilon.$$\n$f$ has a relative minimum at $f$ if there is a value $\\epsilon\u0026gt;0$ such that\n$$f(P)\\leq f(X)\\ \\forall X, |\\vec{PX}|\u0026lt;\\epsilon.$$\nBoth relative maxima and minima are known as relative extrema of $f$.\n  Critical points  Theorem - Critical points. If a scalar field $f$ in $\\mathbb{R}^n$ has a relative maximum or minimum at a point $P$, then $P$ is a critical or stationary point of $f$, that is, a point where the gradient vanishes\n$$\\nabla f(P) = 0.$$\n   Proof  Taking the trajectory that passes through $P$ with the direction of the gradient at that point $$g(t)=P+t\\nabla f(P),$$ the function $h=(f\\circ g)(t)$ does not decrease at $t=0$ since\n$$h'(0)= (f\\circ g)'(0) = \\nabla f(g(0))\\cdot g'(0) = \\nabla f(P)\\cdot \\nabla f(P) = |\\nabla f(P)|^2\\geq 0,$$\nand it only vanishes if $\\nabla f(P)=0$.\nThus, if $\\nabla f(P)\\neq 0$, $f$ can not have a relative maximum at $P$ since following the trajectory of $g$ from $P$ there are points where $f$ has an image greater than the image at $P$. In the same way, following the trajectory of $g$ in the opposite direction there are points where $f$ has an image less than the image at $P$, so $f$ can not have relative minimum at $P$.\n   Example. Given the scalar field $f(x,y)=x^2+y^2$, it is obvious that $f$ only has a relative minimum at $(0,0)$ since\n$$f(0,0)=0 \\leq f(x,y)=x^2+y^2,\\ \\forall x,y\\in \\mathbb{R}.$$\nIs easy to check that $f$ has a critical point at $(0,0)$, that is $\\nabla f(0,0) = 0$.\nSaddle points Not all the critical points of a scalar field are points where the scalar field has relative extrema. If we take, for instance, the scalar field $f(x,y)=x^2-y^2$, its gradient is\n$$\\nabla f(x,y) = (2x,-2y),$$\nthat only vanishes at $(0,0)$. However, this point is not a relative maximum since the points $(x,0)$ in the $x$-axis have images $f(x,0)=x^2\\geq 0=f(0,0)$, nor a relative minimum since the points $(0,y)$ in the $y$-axis have images $f(0,y)=-y^2\\leq 0=f(0,0)$. This type of critical points that are not relative extrema are known as saddle points.\nAnalysis of the relative extrema From the second degree Taylorâs formula of a scalar field $f$ at a point $P$ we have\n$$f(P+\\mathbf{v})-f(P)\\approx \\nabla f(P)\\mathbf{v}+\\frac{1}{2}\\nabla^2f(P)\\mathbf{v}\\cdot\\mathbf{v}.$$\nThus, if $P$ is a critical point of $f$, as $\\nabla f(P)=0$, we have\n$$f(P+\\mathbf{v})-f(P)\\approx \\frac{1}{2}\\nabla^2f(P)\\mathbf{v}\\cdot\\mathbf{v}.$$\nTherefore, the sign of the $f(P+\\mathbf{v})-f(P)$ is the sign of the second degree term $\\nabla^2f(P)\\mathbf{v}\\cdot\\mathbf{v}$.\nThere are four possibilities:\n  Definite positive: $\\nabla^2f(P)\\mathbf{v}\\cdot\\mathbf{v}\u0026gt;0$ $\\forall \\mathbf{v}\\neq 0$.\n  Definite negative: $\\nabla^2f(P)\\mathbf{v}\\cdot\\mathbf{v}\u0026lt;0$ $\\forall \\mathbf{v}\\neq 0$.\n  Indefinite: $\\nabla^2f(P)\\mathbf{v}\\cdot\\mathbf{v}\u0026gt;0$ for some $\\mathbf{v}\\neq 0$ and $\\nabla^2f(P)\\mathbf{u}\\cdot\\mathbf{u}\u0026lt;0$ for some $\\mathbf{u}\\neq 0$.\n  Semidefinite: In any other case.\n  Thus, depending on de sign of $\\nabla^2 f(P)\\mathbf{v}\\cdot\\mathbf{v}$, we have\n Theorem. Given a critical point $P$ of a scalar field $f$, it holds that\n If $\\nabla^2f(P)$ is definite positive then $f$ has a relative minimum at $P$. If $\\nabla^2f(P)$ is definite negative then $f$ has a relative maximum at $P$. If $\\nabla^2f(P)$ is indefinite then $f$ has a saddle point at $P$.  When $\\nabla^2f(P)$ is semidefinite we can not draw any conclusion and we need higher order partial derivatives to classify the critical point.\n  Analysis of the relative extrema of a scalar field in $\\mathbb{R}^2$ In the particular case of a scalar field of two variables, we have\n Theorem. Given a critical point $P=(x_0,y_0)$ of a scalar field $f(x,y)$, it holds that\n If $Hf(P)\u0026gt;0$ and $\\dfrac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial x^2}(x_0,y_0)\u0026gt;0$ then $f$ has a relative minimum at $P$. If $Hf(P)\u0026gt;0$ and $\\dfrac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial x^2}(x_0,y_0)\u0026lt;0$ then $f$ has a relative maximum at $P$. IF $Hf(P)\u0026lt;0$ then $f$ has a saddle point at $P$.    Example. Given the scalar field $f(x,y)=\\dfrac{x^3}{3}-\\dfrac{y^3}{3}-x+y$, its gradient is\n$$\\nabla f(x,y)= (x^2-1,-y^2+1),$$\nand it has critical points at $(1,1)$, $(1,-1)$, $(-1,1)$ and $(-1,-1)$.\nThe hessian matrix is\n$$\\nabla^2f(x,y) = \\left( \\begin{array}{cc} 2x \u0026amp; 0\\newline 0 \u0026amp; -2y \\end{array} \\right)$$\nand the hessian is\n$$Hf(x,y) = -4xy.$$\nThus, we have\n  Point $(1,1)$: $Hf(1,1)=-4\u0026lt;0 \\Rightarrow$ Saddle point.\n  Point $(1,-1)$: $Hf(1,-1)=4\u0026gt;0$ and $\\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial x^2}(1,-1)=2\u0026gt;0 \\Rightarrow$ Relative min.\n  Point $(-1,1)$: $Hf(-1,1)=4\u0026gt;0$ and $\\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial x^2}(-1,1)=-2\u0026lt;0 \\Rightarrow$ Relative max.\n  Point $(-1,-1)$: $Hf(-1,-1)=-4\u0026lt;0 \\Rightarrow$ Saddle point.\n  The graph of the function $f(x,y)=\\dfrac{x^3}{3}-\\dfrac{y^3}{3}-x+y$ and their relative extrema and saddle points are shown below.\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1600986575,"objectID":"b82b8cd53b4f3645f020f7b3a65480d0","permalink":"/en/teaching/calculus/manual/derivatives-n-variables/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/en/teaching/calculus/manual/derivatives-n-variables/","section":"teaching","summary":"Vector functions of a single real variable  Definition - Vector function of a single real variable.

Is this prediction reliable?\n  How much will the number of absences increase or decrease for every increment of 1000â¬ in the salary?\n  Use the following sums for the computations:\n$\\sum x_i=270$ $10^3$â¬, $\\sum y_i=14.9$ absences,\n$\\sum x_i^2=8475$ ($10^3$â¬)$^2$, $\\sum y_i^2=27.11$ absences$^2$,\n$\\sum x_iy_j=420$ $10^3$â¬ absences.\n Solution    $\\bar x=30$ $10^3$â¬, $s_x^2=41.6667$ ($10^3$â¬)$^2$,\n$\\bar y=1.6556$ absences, $s_y^2=0.2714$ absences$^2$,\n$s_{xy}=-3$ $10^3$â¬ absences.\nRegression line of absences on salary: $y=3.8156-0.072x$.\n  $y(29) = 1.7276$ absences.\n$r^2 = 0.796$, thus the model fits well as the coefficient of determination is not far from 1, but the sample size is too small to be reliable the prediction.\n  The number of absences will decrease 0.072 for every increment of 1000â¬ in the salary.\n     Question 3 In a regression study it is known that the regression line of $Y$ on $X$ is $y+2x-10=0$ and the regression line of $X$ on $Y$ is $y+3x-14=0$.\n  Compute the means of $X$ and $Y$.\n  Compute the linear correlation coefficient and interpret it.\n   Solution    $\\bar x=4$ and $\\bar y=2$.\n  $r=-0.8165$. The linear correlation coefficient is near -1 so there is a strong inverse relation between $X$ and $Y$.\n     Question 4 A test to detect prostate cancer produces 1% of false positives and 0.2% false negatives. It is known that 1 in 400 males suffer this type of cancer.\n  Compute the sensitivity and the specificity of the test.\n  If a male got a positive outcome in the test, what is the chance of developing cancer?\n  Compute and interpret the negative predictive value.\n  Is this test better to predict or to rule out the cancer?\n  To study whether there is an association between the practice of sports and this type of cancer, a sample of 1000 males was drawn, of which 700 practised sports, and it was observed that there were 2 males with cancer in the group of males who practised sports, and there were 3 males with cancer in the group of males who did not practice sports. Compute the relative risk and the odds ratio and interpret them.\n   Solution  Let $D$ the event corresponding to suffering prostate cancer and $+$ and $-$ the events corresponding to get a positive and a negative outcome respectively.\n  The sensitivity is $P(+|D) = 0.2$ and specificity $P(-|\\overline D) = 0.99$.\n  Positive predictive value $P(D|+) = 0.0476$.\n  Negative predictive value $P(\\overline D|-) = 0.998$.\n  As the positive predictive value is smaller than the negative predictive value, this test is better to rule out the disease. In fact, we can not use this test to detect the prostate cancer because the positive predictive value is less than 0.5.\n  $RR(D)=0.2857$ and $OR(D)=0.2837$. Thus, there is an association between the practice of sports and the prostate cancer and the risks and the odds of developing cancer is almost one fourth smaller if the male practice sports.\n      ResoluciÃ³n       Question 5 The probability that a child of a mother with the color-blind gene and a father without the color-blind gene is a color-blind male is $0.25$. It is also known that in a population there is one color-blind male for every 5000 males.\n  If this couple has 5 children, what is the probability that at most 2 of them are color-blind males?\n  If this couple has 5 children, and the gender of the children is equiprobable, what is the probability that 3 or more are females?\n  In a random sample of 10000 males of this population, what is the probability that more than 3 are color-blind males?\n   Solution    Let $X$ be the number of color-blind sons in a sample of 5 children, then $X\\sim B(5, 0.25)$ and $P(X\\leq 2)=0.8965$.\n  Let $Y$ be the number of girls in a sample of 5 children, then $Y\\sim B(5, 0.5)$ and $P(Y\\geq 3)=0.5$.\n  Let $Z$ be the number of color-blind males in a sample of 10000 males, then $Z\\sim B(10000, 0.0002)\\approx P(2)$ and $P(Z\u0026gt;3)=0.1429$.\n      ResoluciÃ³n       Question 6 The primate cranial capacity follows a normal distribution with mean 1200 cm$^3$ and standard deviation 140 cm$^3$.\n  Compute the probability that the cranial capacity of a primate is greater than 1400 cm$^3$.\n  Compute the probability that the cranial capacity of a primate is exactly than 1400 cm$^3$.\n  Above what cranial capacity will 20% of primates be?\n  Compute the interquartile range of the cranial capacity of primates and interpret it.\n   Solution  Let $X$ be the primate cranial capacity. Then $X\\sim N(1200,140)$.\n  $P(X\u0026gt;1400) = 0.0766$.\n  $P(X=1400) = 0$.\n  $P_{80} = 1317.827$ cm$^3$.\n  $Q_1 = 1105.5714$ cm$^3$, $Q_3 = 1294.4286$ cm$^3$ and $IQR = 188.8571$ cm$^3$. Thus the 50% of central data will be concentranted in an interval of width $188.8571$ cm$^3$, that is a small spread.\n      ResoluciÃ³n       ","date":1610928000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1612657121,"objectID":"4c570671d341494644ab5f9fa875dc09","permalink":"/en/teaching/statistics/exams/pharmacy/pharmacy-2021-01-18/","publishdate":"2021-01-18T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/en/teaching/statistics/exams/pharmacy/pharmacy-2021-01-18/","section":"teaching","summary":"Degrees: Pharmacy, Biotechnology\nDate: January 18, 2021\nQuestion 1 The table below contains the differences between the grades in the final school exam and the entrance exam in a sample of public high schools ($X$) and private high schools ($Y$):","tags":["Exam","Statistics","Biostatistics"],"title":"Pharmacy exam 2021-01-18","type":"book"},{"authors":null,"categories":["Statistics","Biostatistics","Pharmacy","Biotechnology"],"content":"Degrees: Pharmacy, Biotechnology\nDate: November 23, 2020\nQuestion 1 A test to detect the COVID19 was applied to 850 persons infected by COVID19 with a positive outcome in 800 of them, and it was also applied to 9150 non-infected persons with a positive outcome in 10% of them.\n  Compute the sensitivity and the specificity of the test.\n  Compute the positive and the negative predictive values and interpret them.\n  Compute the probability of a correct diagnostic.\n   Solution  Let $D$ the event corresponding to suffering COVID19 and $+$ and $-$the events corresponding to get a positive and a negative outcome respectively.\n  The sensitivity is $P(+|D) = 0.9412$ and specificity $P(-|\\overline D) = 0.9$.\n  Positive predictive value $P(D|+) = 0.4665$ and negative predictive value $P(\\overline D|-) = 0.994$.

Compute the probability that at least 3 of them blink in their first minute of life.\n  In which distribution is more representative the mean, in the number of times that a newborn blinks in a minute or in the number of times that a newborn blinks in half a minute?\n   Solution   Let $X$ be the number of times that a newborn blinks in half a minute, then $X\\sim P(1)$ and $P(X=2)=0.1839$. Let $Y$ be the number of newborns that blink in their first minute of life in a sample of 5 newborns, then $Y\\sim B(5,0.8647)$ and $P(Y\\geq 3)=0.98$. Let $Z$ be the number of times that a newborn blinks in a minute, then $cv_z = 0.7071$ and $cv_x = 1$. Thus, the mean of $Z$ represents better since its coefficient of variation is smaller.     Question 3 The prolactin level in pregnant and non-pregnant females follows anormal distribution with different means but with the same variance.When the prolactin levels exceed 15 ng/ml, females secrete milk through their mammary glands. It is known that 95% of pregnant females secrete milk but only 1% of non-pregnant females secret milk.\n  If the median of the prolactin level in pregnant females is 16 ng/ml, what are the means and the standard deviation of the prolactin level in both populations?\n  Compute the percentage of pregnant females with a prolactin level between 15.5 and 17 ng/ml.\n  Compute the prolactin level such that 20% of pregnant females are above that level.\n   Solution  Let $X$ and $Y$ be the prolactin levels in pregnant and non-pregnant females respectively.\n  $\\mu_x=16$ ng/ml, $\\mu_y=13.5857$ ng/ml and $\\sigma=0.608$ ng/ml.\n  $P(15.5\u0026lt;X\u0026lt;17) = 0.7446$, so 74.4583% of pregnant females.\n  $P_{80} = 16.5117$ ng/ml.\n     Question 4 An organism has the same chance of being infected by a virus and a bacteria.

Use the following sums for the computations:\nPrevious year course: $\\sum x_in_i=84$, $\\sum x_i^2n_i=254$, $\\sum (x_i-\\bar x)^3n_i=122.99$ y $\\sum (x_i-\\bar x)^4n_i=669.21$.\nCurrent course: $\\sum y_in_i=91$, $\\sum y_i^2n_i=341$, $\\sum (y_i-\\bar y)^3n_i=301.16$ y $\\sum (y_i-\\bar y)^4n_i=2012.88$.\n Show solution   Both distributions are pretty similar. The central dispersion is the same and both are right skewed. The only difference is that there is an outlier in the current year distribution. Previous year course: $\\bar x=1.8667$, $s^2=2.16$, $s=1.4697$, $g_1=0.8609$ and $g_2=0.1874$. Current course: $\\bar y=2.1163$, $s^2=3.4516$, $s=1.8578$, $g_1=1.0922$ and $g_2=0.9292$. As the coefficients of skewness and kurtosis are between -2 and 2, we can assume that both distributions come from a normal distribution. Previous year course: $cv=0.7873$. Current year: $cv=0.8779$. Thus, the mean is more representative in the previous year course, since the coefficient of variation is smaller. Previous year course: $z(6)=2.8124$. Current course: $z(7)=2.6287$. Thus, 7 failed subjects in the current course is relatively less than 6 in the previous year course, since the standard score is smaller.     Question 2 A study tries to develop a new technique for detecting a certain antibody.

Question 4 The sensitivity and specificity of a diagnostic test are 0.58 and 0.01, respectively, and the probability of a true positive is 0.02.\n  Calculate the prevalence of the disease.\n  Calculate predictive values.\n  Is the test more useful to rule out or confirm the disease?\n  If we have 10 non-sick patients, what is the probability that more than 9 have a misdiagnosis?\n  If we have 60 patients, what is the probability that at least two of them have a correct diagnosis?\n   Show solution   $P(D) = 0.0345$. $PPV = P(D|+) = 0.0205$ and $NPV = P(\\overline D|-) = 0.4$. The test is not helpful to confirm nor to rule out the disease, since both the positive and the negative predictive values are below 0.5. Let $X$ be the number non sick patients with a positive outcome, then $X\\sim B(10, 0.99)$, and $P(X\\geq 9)=0.9957$. Let $Y$ be the number of patients with a right diagnose, then $Y\\sim B(60, 0.0297)\\approx P(1.7793)$, and $P(Y\\geq 2)=0.531$.

The sample of non-working students has a slightly higher relative dispersion with respect to the mean as the coefficient of variation is greater. Non-working students: $g_1=-0.4687$.

Probability and Random Variables Question 3 A hospital orders a DNA compatibility test to three labs A, B and C. Lab A performs 40 test a day, lab B 50, and lab C 60. It is known that the probability of a wrong diagnose is 20% in lab A, 18% in lab B and 22% in lab C. If we select a random test of the hospital,\n  Compute the probability of wrong diagnose in that test.\n  If the test is wrong, what is the probability that it has been performed by lab B?\n  If the test is right, which lab is more likely to have performed the test?\n   Solution  Let $A$, $B$ and $C$ be the events of performing the test in labs $A$, $B$ and $C$ respectively, and $R$ the event of getting a right diagnose. According to the statement $P(A)=0.2667$, $P(B)=0.3333$, $P(C)=0.4$, $P(R|A)=0.8$, $P(R|B)=0.82$ and $P(R|C)=0.78$.\n $P(\\overline R) = 0.2013$. $P(B|\\overline R) = 0.298$. $P(A|R) = 0.2671$, $P(B|R) = 0.3422$ and $P(C|R) = 0.3907$, thus, it is more likely that it has been performed in lab $C$.     Question 4 An epidemiological study tries to determine the effectiveness of face masks to prevent the COVID19. In a sample 4000 persons without the virus and 1000 persons with it were selected. I was observed that in the group of infected people 120 had used face masks in the two previous weeks, while in the non-infected group, 1250 had used face masks in the two previous weeks.\n  Compute the relative risk of been infected with face masks.\n  Compute the odds ratio of been infected with face masks.\n  Which association measure is more reliable?\n   Solution  Let $D$ be the event of being infected.\n $RR(D)=0.3613$. Thus, the risk of being infected with face mask is almost one third of the likelihood of been infected without face mask. $OR(D)=0.3$. Thus, the odds of being infected with face mask is less than one third of the likelihood of been infected without face mask. As we can not compute the prevalence of $D$, the odds ratio is more reliable.

Assuming that the calls are equally distributed among the operators,\n  Compute the probability that an operator received more than 3 calls a day.\n  Compute the probability that all the the operators received some call a day.\n   Solution   Let $X$ be the number of calls that arrive to one operator, then $X\\sim P(3)$, and $P(X\u0026gt;3)=0.3528$. Let $Y$ be the number of operators that receive some call, then $Y\\sim B(4, 0.9502)$, and $P(Y=4)=0.8152$.     Question 6 In a course with 200 students the score of a test to measure the intelligence quotient follows a normal distribution. After applying the test to the students 10 of them got a score above 130 and 30 of them a score below 60.\n  Compute the mean and the standard deviation of the score.\n  How many students will have a score between 90 and 95?\n  Compute the limits of the interval centered at the mean that accumulates 95% of the scores.\n   Solution   Let $X$ be the score of the test then $X\\sim N(87.058, 26.1069)$ $P(90\\leq X \\leq 95) = 0.0747$, that is, around $14.9309$ students.

Methods: 1001 patients were enrolled, of whom 766 were healthy subjects and 235 were ocular hypertensive or glaucomatous patients in different stages of the disease. Spectral domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) was used to determine Bruchâs membrane opening-minimum rim width (BMO-MRW) and the thicknesses of peripapillary retinal nerve fibre layer (RNFL) rings with diameters of 3.0, 4.1 and 4.7 mm centred on the optic nerve. The BMO-MRW rim and RNFL rings were divided into seven sectors (G-T-TS-TI-N-NS-NI). The k-means algorithm and linear discriminant analysis were used to classify patients into disease stages. Results: We defined four glaucoma stages and provided a new model for classifying eyes into these stages, with an overall accuracy greater than 92% (88% when including healthy eyes). An online application was also implemented to predict the probability of glaucoma stage for any given eye.

Thus the representativity of the mean is moderate. $P_{85}=99.375$ min. Applying the linear transformation $y=0.75x$, $\\bar y=48.1875$ min, $s_y=22.0717$ min and $cv=0.458$. Thus the representativity of the mean is the same. Standard score in first anesthesia: $z(70)=0.1954$. Standard score in anesthesia $B$: $z(60)=0.6667$. Thus, 60 min with anesthesia $B$ is relatively greater.     Question 2 The table below summarizes the scores of a group of 10 students in three practical exams of Maths.\n$$ \\begin{array}{rrr} \\mbox{Exam 1} (X) \u0026amp; \\mbox{Exam 2} (Y) \u0026amp; \\mbox{Exam 3} (Z) \\newline \\hline 5.5 \u0026amp; 3.2 \u0026amp; 5.0 \\newline 7.5 \u0026amp; 6.5 \u0026amp; 2.0 \\newline 2.5 \u0026amp; 4.0 \u0026amp; 1.0 \\newline 6.0 \u0026amp; 4.0 \u0026amp; 6.0 \\newline 8.0 \u0026amp; 7.5 \u0026amp; 6.0 \\newline 4.0 \u0026amp; 3.5 \u0026amp; 1.0 \\newline 7.0 \u0026amp; 5.5 \u0026amp; 4.0 \\newline 9.5 \u0026amp; 10.0 \u0026amp; 9.0 \\newline 10.0 \u0026amp; 9.5 \u0026amp; 8.0 \\newline 1.0 \u0026amp; 3.0 \u0026amp; 0.5 \\newline \\hline \\end{array} $$\n  Which two scores are more linearly correlated?\n  Using linear models, what are the expected scores of the second and third exams for a student with a score $6.5$ in the first exam?\n  Use the following sums for the computations:\n$\\sum x_i=61$, $\\sum y_i=56.7$, $\\sum z_i=42.5$,\n$\\sum x_i^2=449$, $\\sum y_i^2=382.49$, $\\sum z_i^2=264.25$,\n$\\sum x_iy_j=405.85$, $\\sum x_iz_j=327$, $\\sum y_jz_j=295$.\n Solution   $\\bar x=6.1$, $s_x^2=7.69$, $\\bar y=5.67$, $s_y^2=6.1001$, $\\bar z=4.25$, $s_z^2=8.3625$, $s_{xy}=5.998$, $s_{xz}=6.775$, $s_{yz}=5.4025$, $r^2_{xy}=0.7669$, $r^2_{xz}=0.7138$ and $r^2_{yz}=0.5722$. Thus, the two variables more linearly related are $X$ and $Y$, since their coefficient of determination is greater. Regression line of $Y$ on $X$: $y=0.9122 + 0.78x$ and $y(6.5)=5.982$. Regression line of $Z$ on $X$: $z=-1.1242 + 0.881x$ and $z(6.5)=4.6024$.     Question 3 To study the association between the osteoporosis and the gender a random sample of people between 65 and 70 years old was taken. The following table summarize the results\n$$ \\begin{array}{lcc} \\hline \u0026amp; \\mbox{Osteoporosis} \u0026amp; \\mbox{Not osteoporosis}\\newline \\mbox{Women} \u0026amp; 480 \u0026amp; 2320\\newline \\mbox{Men} \u0026amp; 255 \u0026amp; 1505\\newline \\hline \\end{array} $$\n  Compute the prevalence of the osteoporosis in the population.\n  Compute the relative risk of osteoporosis in females with respect to males and interpret it.\n  Compute the odds ratio of osteoporosis in females with respect to males and interpret it.\n  Which of the two measures is most suitable to study the association between the osteoporosis and the gender?\n   Solution  Let $D$ be the event of suffering osteoporosis.\n Prevalence: $P(D)=0.1612$. $RR(D)=1.1832$. Thus, the risk of suffering osteoporosis in women is higher than in men but not to much. There is no strong association between the osteoporosis and the gender. $OR(D)=1.2211$. Thus, the odds of suffering osteoporosis in women is higher than in men but not to much. Since we can compute the prevalence of $D$, both statistics are suitable, but relative risk is easier to interpret.     Question 4 The risks of getting the flu in two cities $A$ and $B$ with the same population size are 14% and 8% respectively.\n  Compute the probability of having more than 2 persons getting the flu in a random sample of 10 persons of the city $A$.\n  Compute the probability of having more than 2 and less than 5 persons getting the flu in a random sample of 50 persons of the city $B$.\n  Compute the probability of having 2 persons getting the flu in a random sample of 8 persons of the two cities.\n  Compute the probability of having some person getting the flu in a random sample of 5 persons that have been living in both cities.\n   Solution   Let $X$ be the number of persons with flu in a sample of 10 persons from $A$, then $X\\sim B(10, 0.14)$ and $P(X\u0026gt;2)=0.1545$. Let $Y$ be the number of persons with flu in a sample of 50 persons from $B$, then $Y\\sim B(50, 0.08)\\approx P(4)$ and $P(2 \u0026lt; Y \u0026lt; 5) = 0.3907$. Let $Z$ be the number of persons with flu in a sample of 8 persons from $A$ and $B$, then $Z\\sim B(8, 0.11)$ and $P(Z = 2) = 0.1684$. Let $U$ be the number of persons with flu in a sample of 5 persons living in both cities, then $U\\sim B(5, 0.2088)$ and $P(U\u0026gt;0)=0.69$.     Question 5 In a study about the cholesterol two samples of 10000 males and 10000 females was taken. It was observed that 3420 males and 1234 females had a cholesterol level above 230 mg/dl, and that 4936 males had a cholesterol level between 210 and 230 mg/dl. Assuming that the cholesterol level in males and females follows a normal distribution with the same standard deviation, compute:\n  The means and the standard deviation of the distributions of cholesterol level in males and females.\n  The percentage of males with cholesterol level between 200 and 240 mg/dl.\n  The interquartile range of the cholesterol level of females.\n   Solution   Let $X$ be cholesterol level in males and $Y$ the cholesterol level in females, then $X\\sim N(224.1164, 14.4556)$ and $X\\sim N(213.2581, 14.4556)$. $P(200\\leq X \\leq 240) = 0.8164$. $IQR = 19.5003$ mg/dl.

Question 2 In a stretch of a road there is an average of 2 accidents per day.\n  Compute the probability of having more than 2 accidents a random day.\n  Compute the probability of having more than 2 accidents a random day, knowing that there is at least one accident that day.\n  Compute the probability of having 14 accidents a random week.\n   Solution   Let $X$ be the number of accidents in a day. $X\\sim P(2)$ and $P(X\u0026gt;2)=0.3233$. $P(X\u0026gt;2|X\\geq 1)=0.3739$.

Question 3 In a study about the effectiveness of two flu drugs $A$ and $B$ it has been observed in a clinical trial that in 12% of cases only drug $A$ is effective, in 24% of cases only drug $B$ is effective and in 80% of cases where drug $A$ was effective, also was effective the drug $B$.\n  What is the probability that both drugs are effective at the same time?\n  What is the probability that only one of the drugs is effective?\n  What is the probability that none of the drugs are effective?\n  Are the effectiveness of the two drugs independent?\n   Solution  According to the problem statement, $P(A\\cap \\overline B) = 0.12$, $P(\\overline A\\cap B)=0.24$ and $P(B|A)=0.8$.\n $P(A\\cap B)=0.48$. $P(A\\cap \\overline B) + P(\\overline A\\cap B) =0.36$. $P(\\overline A \\cap \\overline B) = 0.16$.

According to skewness and kurtosis can we assume that populations $A$ and $B$ are normal?\n  In which group is more representative the mean of the systolic blood pressure?\n  Compute the value of the systolic blood pressure such that 30% of persons of the group of population $A$ are above it?\n  Which systolic blood pressure is relatively higher, 132 mmHg in the group of population $A$, or 130 mmHg in the group of population $B$?\n  If we measure the systolic blood pressure of the group of population $A$ with another tensiometer, and the new pressure obtained ($Y$) is related with the first one ($X$) according to the equation $y=0.98x-1.4$, in which distribution, $X$ or $Y$, is more representative the mean?\n  Use the following sums for the computations:\nGroup $A$: $\\sum x_in_i=11520$ mmHg, $\\sum x_i^2n_i=1351700$ mmHg$^2$, $\\sum (x_i-\\bar x)^3n_i=155241.6$ mmHg$^3$ and $\\sum (x_i-\\bar x)^4n_i=16729903.52$ mmHg$^4$.\nGroup $B$: $\\sum x_in_i=11000$ mmHg, $\\sum x_i^2n_i=1230300$ mmHg$^2$, $\\sum (x_i-\\bar x)^3n_i=165000$ mmHg$^3$ and $\\sum (x_i-\\bar x)^4n_i=13632500$ mmHg$^4$.\n Solution   Group $A$: $\\bar x=115.2$ mmHg, $s^2=245.96$ mmHg$^2$, $s=15.6831$ mmHg, $g_{1A}=0.4024$ and $g_{2A}=-0.2346$. Group $B$: $\\bar x=110$ mmHg, $s^2=203$ mmHg$^2$, $s=14.2478$ mmHg, $g_{1B}=0.5705$ and $g_{2B}=0.3081$. Thus the distribution of the population $A$ group is less asymmetric since $g_{1A}$ is closer to 0 than $g_{1B}$ and the populaton $B$ group has a higher kurtosis since $g_{2B}\u0026gt;g_{2A}$. Both populations can be cosidered normal since $g_1$ and $g_2$ are between -2 and 2. $cv_A=0.1361$ and $cv_B=0.1295$, thus, the mean of group $B$ is a little bit more representative since its coef. of variation is smaller than the one of group $A$. $P_{70}\\approx 125$ mmHg. The standard scores are $z_A(132)=1.0712$ and $z_B(130)=1.4037$. Thus, 130 mmHg in group $B$ is relatively higher than 132 mmHg in group $A$. $\\bar y=111.496$, $s_y=15.3694$ and $cv_y=0.1378$.

Yes, because $2\u0026lt;f_1$.     Question 3 A pharmaceutical company is trying three different analgesics to determine if there is a relation among the time required for them to take effect. The three analgesics were administered to a sample of 20 patients and the time it took for them to take effect was recorded. The following sums summarize the results, where $X$, $Y$ and $Z$ are the times for the three analgesics.\n$\\sum x_i=668$ min, $\\sum y_i=855$ min, $\\sum z_i=1466$ min,\n$\\sum x_i^2=25056$ min$^2$, $\\sum y_i^2=42161$ min$^2$, $\\sum z_i^2=123904$ min$^2$,\n$\\sum x_iy_j=31522$ min$^2$, $\\sum y_jz_j=54895$ min$^2$.\n  Is there a linear relation between the times $X$ and $Y$?

Why?\n  Using the chosen linear regression model in the previous question, predict the value of $Y$ for a value of $X$ or $Z$ of 40 minutes.\n  If the correlation coefficient between the times $X$ and $Z$ is $r=-0.69$, compute the regression line of $X$ on $Z$.\n   Solution   $\\bar x=33.4$ min, $s_x^2=137.24$ min$^2$, $\\bar y=42.75$ min, $s_y^2=280.4875$ min$^2$, $\\bar z=73.3$ min, $s_z^2=822.31$ min$^2$, $s_{xy}=148.25$ min$^2$ and $s_{yz}=-388.825$ min$^2$. Thus, there is a direct linear relation between $X$ and $Y$ and an inverse linear relation between $Y$ and $Z$. $b_{xy}=0.5285$ min. $r^2_{xy}=0.5709$ and $r^2_{yz}=0.6555$, thus the regression line of $Y$ on $Z$ explains better $Y$ than the regression line of $Y$ on $X$ since $r^2_{yz}\u0026gt;r^2_{xy}$. Regression line of $Y$ on $Z$: $y=77.4095 + -0.4728z$ and $y(40)=58.4957$. $s_{xz}=-231.7967$ and the regression line of $X$ on $Z$ is $x=54.0622 + -0.2819z$.

Without prevention program: $\\bar y=4.7143$ injuries, $s^2=3.6327$ injuries$^2$, $s=1.906$ injuries and $cv=0.4043$. The sample following the prevention program has a greater relative spread with respect to the mean since the coef. of variation is greater. With prevention program: $g_2=-0.6722$. Without prevention program: $g_2=0.1768$. Thus the sample not following the prevention program has a more normal kurtosis, since the coeff. of kurtosis is closer to 0. With prevention program: $z(2)=-0.2847$. Without prevention program: $z(4)=-0.3748$. Thus 4 injuries in the sample not following the prevention program is relatively smaller, since its standard score is smaller.

In the following 5 years it was observed that 21 individuals suffered spinal injuries in the group following the prevention program while 48 individuals suffered spinal injuries in the other group.\n  Compute the cumulative incidence of spinal injuries in the total sample after 5 years and after 10 years.\n  Compute the absolute risk of suffering spinal injuries in 10 years in the treatment and control groups.\n  Compute the relative risk of suffering spinal injuries in 10 years in the treatment group compared to the control group. Interpret it.\n  Compute the odds ratio of suffering spinal injuries in 10 years in the treatment group compared to the control group. Interpret it.\n  Which statistics, the relative risk or the odds ratio, is more suitable in this study? Justify the answer.\n   Solution  Let $D$ be the event of suffering spinal injuries.\n  Cumulative incidence after 5 years: $R(D)=0.088$. Cumulative incidence after 10 years: $R(D)=0.226$.\n  Risk in the treatment group: $R_T(D)=0.132$. Risk in the control group: $R_C(D)=0.32$.\n  $RR(D)=0.4125$. Thus, the risk of suffering spinal injuries is less than half following the prevention program.\n  $OR(D)=0.3232$. Thus, the odd of suffering spinal injuries is less than one third following the prevention program.\n  Since the study is prospective and we can estimate the prevalence of $D$, both statistics are suitable, but relative risk is easier to interpret.\n     Question 5 The table below shows the results of a study to evaluate the usefulness of a reactive strip to diagnose an urinary infection.\n$$ \\begin{array}{ccc} \\hline \\mbox{Outcome} \u0026amp; \\mbox{Infection} \u0026amp; \\mbox{No infection}\\newline \\mbox{Positive} \u0026amp; 60 \u0026amp; 80\\newline \\mbox{Negative} \u0026amp; 10 \u0026amp; 200\\newline \\hline \\end{array} $$\n  Compute the sensitivity and the specificity of the test.\n  Compute the positive and the negative predictive values.\nIs this test better to confirm or to rule out the infection?\n  If another study has determined that the true prevalence of the infection is 2%, how does this affect to the predictive values?\n   Solution  Let $D$ be the event corresponding to suffering the urinary infection and $+$ and $-$ the events corresponding to get a positive and negative outcome in the test respectively.\n  Sensitivity = $0.8571$ and Specificity = $0.7143$.\n  $PPV=0.4286$ and $NPV=0.9524$. Since the $PPV\u0026lt;NPV$ the test is better to rule out the infection.\n  $PPV=0.0577$ and $NPV=0.9959$. The positive predictive value descreases a lot while the negative predictive value increases al little bit.\n     Question 6 The time required to recover from an injury follows a normal distribution with variance 64 days.\nIt is also known that 10% of people with this injury require more than 80 days to recover.\n  What is the expected time required to recover from the injury?\n  What percentage of individuals will require between 60 and 75 days to recover?\n  If we draw a random sample of 12 individuals with this injury, what is the probability of having between 9 and 11 individuals, both included, requiring less than 80 days to recover?\n  If we draw a random sample of 500 individuals with this injury, what is the probability of having less than 4 requiring a time above the 99th percentile to recover?\n   Solution  Let $X$ be the time required to recover from the injury. Then $X\\sim N(\\mu, 8)$.\n  $\\mu=69.7476$ days.\n  $P(60\u0026lt;X\u0026lt;75) = 0.6327$.\n  Let $Y$ be the number of individuals with the injury requiring less than 80 days to recover in a sample of 12. Then $Y\\sim B(12, 0.9)$ and $P(9\\leq Y\\leq 11)=0.6919$.\n  Let $Z$ be the number of individuals with the injury requiring a time above the 99th percentile to recover in a sample of 500.

Thus the distribution is a little bit right-skewed. $cv_x=0.5015$, $\\bar y=13.925$ drugs, $s_y=5.9808$ drugs and $cv_y=0.4295$. Thus, the mean of $y$ is more representative than the mean of $x$ since its coef. of variation is smaller. $z_x=-0.4891$ and $z_y=-0.8235$, therefore 9 defective drugs in the $y$ machine is relatively smaller.     Question 2 A pharmaceutical laboratory produces two models of blood pressure monitor, one for the arm and the other for the wrist. To compare the accuracy of both blood pressure monitors, a quality control has been conducted with a sample of 20 patients, getting the following results:\n$\\sum x_i=265.4$ mmHg, $\\sum y_i=262.5$ mmHg , $\\sum z_i=262.4$ mmHg,\n$\\sum x_i^2=3701.14$ mmHg$^2$, $\\sum y_i^2=3629.41$ mmHg$^2$, $\\sum z_i^2=3615.38$ mmHg$^2$,\n$\\sum x_iy_j=3658.28$ mmHg$^2$, $\\sum x_iz_j=3655.95$ mmHg$^2$, $\\sum y_jz_j=3613.97$ mmHg$^2$.\nWhere $X$ is the blood pressure with the arm monitor, $Y$ with the wrist monitor and $Z$ the real blood pressure.\n Which blood pressure monitor predicts better the real blood pressure with a linear regression model? If a patient has a real blood pressure of $13.5$ mmHg, what is the expected blood pressure given by the arm blood pressure monitor?   Solution   Blood pressure with the arm monitor: $\\bar x=13.27$ mmHg, $s^2_x=8.9641$ mmHgÂ².\nBlood pressure with the wrist monitor: $\\bar y=13.125$ mmHg, $s^2_y=9.2049$ mmHgÂ².\nReal blood pressure: $\\bar z=13.12$ mmHg, $s^2_z=8.6346$ mmHgÂ². $s_{xz}=8.6951$ mmHgÂ², $s_{yz}=8.4985$ mmHgÂ², $r^2_{xz}=0.9768$ and $r^2_{yz}=0.9087$.\nThus, the arm monitor predicts better the real pressure with a linear regression model since its linear coef. of determination is greater. Regression line of $X$ on $Z$: $x=0.0581+1.007z$.\nPrediction: $x(13.5)=13.6527$ mmHg.     Question 3 The regression line of $Y$ on $X$ is $y=1.2x-0.6$.\nol ol { list-style-type: lower-alpha; }   Which of the following lines can not be the regression line of $X$ on $Y$. Justify the answer.  $x=0.9y-0.6$ $x=-0.7y+0.4$ $x=0.8y-0.7$ $x=-0.6y-0.5$ $x=0.4y-0.6$ $x=-0.5y+0.9$   Considering only the ones that can be the regression line of $X$ on $Y$, which one will give better predictions? Justify the answer.   Solution   (b), (d) and (f) are not possible because the slope is negative, and (a) is not possible because the coef. of determination is greater than 1. (c) gives better predictions because its coef. of determination is greater.     Question 4 In an epidemiological study a sample of 400 persons with breast cancer was drawn and another sample of 1200 persons without breast cancer. In the sample of persons with breast cancer there was 180 smokers, while in the sample of persons without breast cancer there was 1140 non-smokers.\n Compute the relative risk of developing cancer smoking and interpret it. Compute the odds ratio of developing cancer smoking and interpret it.   Solution  Let $C$ be the event of having cancer.\n $RR(C)=4.6364$. That means that the probability of having cancer smoking is $4.6364$ times higher than non-smoking. $OR(C)=15.5455$. As is posibive there is a direct association between smoking and having cancer. The odds of having cancer smoking is more than 15 times greater than non-smoking.     Question 5 We want to develop a diagnostic test to rule out a disease when the outcome of the test is negative (negative predictive value) with a probability 90% at least. It is known that the prevalence of the disease in the population is 15% and the sensitivity of the test is set to 80%.\n What must be the minimum specificity of the test? Using the previous specificity, compute the probability of a correct diagnostic. If we apply the same test two times to the same patient with negative outcomes, what is the probability of ruling out the disease?   Solution  Let $D$ be the event of having the disease and $+$ and $-$ the events of getting a positive and a negative outcome in the diagnostic test respectively.\n Minimum specificity $P(-|\\overline{D})=0.3176$. $P(TP) + P(TN) = P(D\\cap +) + P(\\overline{D}\\cap -) = 0.12+0.27 = 0.39$. $P(\\overline{D}| -_1\\cap -_2)=0.9346$.     Question 6 It is known that in a city one out of 20 persons, in average, has blood type $AB$.\n If we draw randomly 200 blood donors, what is the probability of having at least 5 with blood type $AB$? If we draw randomly 10 blood donors, what is the probability of having more than 8 with blood type different of $AB$?   Solution   Let $X$ be the number of donors with blood type $AB$ in a sample of 200 blood donors. Then $X\\sim B(200,1/20)\\approx P(10)$, and $P(X\\geq 5)=0.9707$. Let $Y$ be the number of donors with no blood type $AB$ in a sample of 10 blood donors. Then $Y\\sim B(10,19/20)$, and $P(Y\u0026gt;8)=0.9139$.     Question 7 In a course there are 150 females and 80 males. It is known that the distribution of scores of females and males are normal with the same standard deviation. It is also known that there are 120 females and 56 males with a score greater than 5, and 36 males with a score between 5 and 7.\n Compute the means and standard deviations of the distributions of scores of females and males. How many females will have a score between 4.5 and 8? Above what score will be 10% of females?   Solution  Let $X$ be score of a random male in the course and $Y$ the score of a random female in the course. Then $X\\sim N(\\mu_x,\\sigma)$ and $Y\\sim N(\\mu_y,\\sigma)$.\n $\\mu_x=5.87$, $\\mu_y=6.41$ and $\\sigma=1.68$. $P(4.5\\leq Y\\leq 8) = 0.7018$, that is, $105.27$ females. $P_{90}=8.8$.

Question 2 In a study about the blood pressure the systolic pressure of 2400 males older than 18 was measured. It was observed that 640 had a pressure greater than 14 mmHg and 1450 had between 10 and 14 mmHg.

To check the effectiveness of this genetic modification two samples of 20 rats were drawn, ones with the gene modified and the others not, and they were fed with the same diet with different concentrations of palm oil during one month.

In which sample the distribution of cholesterol is more skew? In which sample the kurtosis of the distribution of cholesterol is less normal? Which rat has a cholesterol level relatively bigger, a genetically modified rat with a cholesterol level of 130 mg/dl, or a non genetically modified rat with a cholesterol level of 145 mg/dl? In which sample the regression line of cholesterol on the palm oil quantity fits better? According to the regression line, what level of cholesterol is expected for a genetically modified rat with a diet of 25 gr of palm oil? And for a non genetically modified rat? What amount of palm oil must be supplied to a non genetically modified rat to have a cholesterol level smaller than 150 mg/dl? Is this prediction reliable?   Solution   Non genetically modified rats: $\\bar y=147.2927$ mg/dl, $s^2_y=280.7332$ (mg/dl)Â², $s=16.7551$ mg/dl and $cv_y=0.1138$. Genetically modified rats: $\\bar y=106.3295$ mg/dl, $s^2_y=35.265$ (mg/dl)Â², $s=5.9384$ mg/dl and $cv_y=0.0558$. Thus, the mean of genetically modified rats is more representative since the coef. of variation is smaller. Non genetically modified rats: $g_1=0.0064$. Genetically modified rats: $g_1-0.1503$ Thus, the distribution of genetically modified rats is more skew since the coef. of skewness is further from 0. Non genetically modified rats: $g_2=-0.6416$. Genetically modified rats: $g_2-1.0602$ Thus, the kurtosis of the distribution of genetically modified rats is less normal since the coef. of kurtosis is further from 0. Non genetically modified rats: $z(145)=-0.1368$. Genetically modified rats: $z(130)=3.986$. Thus, a cholesterol level of 130 mg/dl in genetically modified rats is relatively greater than 145 mg/dl in non genetically modidied rats. $\\bar x=32.0323$ gr, $s^2_x=149.3614$ grÂ². Non genetically modified rats: $s_{xy}=189.6733$ gr$\\cdot$mg/dl and $r^2=0.858$. Genetically modified rats: $s_{xy}=69.8861$ gr$\\cdot$mg/dl and $r^2=0.9273$. Thus, the regression line fits better in genetically modified rats since the coef. of determination is greater. Regression line of $Y$ on $X$ in non genetically modified rats: $y=106.615+1.2699x$. Prediction: $y(25)=138.3624$ Regression line of $Y$ on $X$ in genetically modified rats: $y=91.3416+0.4679x$. Prediction: $y(25)=103.0391$ Regression line of $X$ on $Y$ in non genetically modified rats: $x=-67.4838+0.6756y$. Prediction: $x(150)=33.8615$. The prediction is very reliable since the coef. of determination is close to 1.     Question 3 It is known that the regression line of $Y$ on $X$ has equation $3x+2y-4=0$ and it explains half of the variability of $Y$. According to the linear regression model, how much will $X$ change for each unit that increases $Y$?\n Solution  $r^2=0.5$ and $b_{xy}=-\\frac{1}{3}$, so $X$ decreases 1/3 of the increase of $Y$.

The standard scores are $z_x(50)=-0.278$ and $z_y(72)=-0.2402$, thus 50 years is relative smaller in the group of people younger than 65.     Question 2 The table below shows the number of injuries of several teams during a league and the average varm-up time of its players.\n$$ \\begin{array}{lrrrrrrrrrr} \\hline \\mbox{Warm-up time} \u0026amp; 15 \u0026amp; 35 \u0026amp; 22 \u0026amp; 28 \u0026amp; 21 \u0026amp; 18 \u0026amp; 25 \u0026amp; 30 \u0026amp; 23 \u0026amp; 20 \\newline \\mbox{Injuries} \u0026amp; 42 \u0026amp; 2 \u0026amp; 16 \u0026amp; 6 \u0026amp; 17 \u0026amp; 29 \u0026amp; 10 \u0026amp; 3 \u0026amp; 12 \u0026amp; 20 \\newline \\hline \\end{array} $$\n  Draw the scatter plot.\n  Which regression model is more suitable to predict the number of injuries as a function of the warm-up time, the logarithmic or the exponential? Use that regression model to predict the expected number of injuries for a team whose players warm-up 20 minutes a day.\n  Which regression model is more suitable to predict the warm-up time as a function of the number of injuries, the logarithmic or the exponential? Use that regression model to predict the warm-up time required to have no more than 10 injuries in a league.\n  Are these predictions reliable? Which one is more reliable?\n  Use the following sums for the computations ($X$ warm-up time and $Y$ number of injuries):\n$\\sum x_i=237$, $\\sum \\log(x_i)=31.3728$, $\\sum y_j=157$, $\\sum \\log(y_j)=24.0775$,\n$\\sum x_i^2=5937$, $\\sum \\log(x_i)^2=98.9906$, $\\sum y_j^2=3843$, $\\sum \\log(y_j)^2=66.3721$,\n$\\sum x_iy_j=3115$, $\\sum x_i\\log(y_j)=519.1907$, $\\sum \\log(x_i)y_j=465.8093$, $\\sum \\log(x_i)\\log(y_j)=73.3995$.\n Solution      $\\bar x=23.7$ min, $s_x^2=32.01$ min$^2$. $\\bar \\log(x)=3.1373$ log(min), $s_{\\log(x)}^2=0.0565$ log(min)$^2$. $\\bar y=15.7$ injuries, $s_y^2=137.81$ injuries$^2$. $\\bar \\log(y)=2.4078$ log(injuries), $s_{\\log(y)}^2=0.8399$ log(injuries)$^2$. $s_{x\\log(y)}=-5.1446$, $s_{\\log(x)y}=-2.6744$. Exponential determination coefficient: $r^2=0.9844$. Logarithmic determination coefficient: $r^2=0.9185$. So the exponential regression model es better to predict the number of injuries as a function of the warm-up time. Exponential regression model: $y=e^{6.2168+-0.1607x}$.\nPrediction: $y(20)=20.1341$ injuries.\n  The logarithmic model is better to predict the warm-up time as a function of the number or injuries. Logarithmic regression model: $x=164.1851+-47.3292\\log(y)$. Prediction: $x(10)=55.2056112360638$ min.\n  Both predictions are very reliable since de deternation coefficient is very high but the last one is a little less reliable as it is for a value further from the data range.\n     Question 3 An ultrasonic technique is used to diagnose a disease with a sensitivity of 91% and a specificity of 98%. The prevalence of the disease is 20%,\n  If we apply the technique to an individual and the outcome is positive, what is the probability of having the disease for that individual?\n  If the outcome was negative, what is the probability of not having the disease?\n  Is this technique more reliable to confirm or to rule out the disease? Justify the answer.\n  Compute the probability of having a correct diagnose with this technique.\n   Solution  Let $D$ the event corresponding to have the disease and + and - the events corresponding to have a positive and negative outcome respectively in the test.\n $PPV=0.9192$. $NPV=0.9776$. It is more reliable to rule out the disease since the NPV is greater than the PPV. $P(D\\cap +)+P(\\overline D\\cap -) = 0.966$.     Question 4 It is known that the femur length of a fetus with 25 weeks of pregnancy follows a normal distribution with mean 44 mm and standard deviation 2 mm.\n  Compute the probability that the femur length of a fetus with 25 weeks is greater than 46 mm.\n  Compute the probability that the femur lenght of a fetus with 25 weeks is between 46 and 49 mm.\n  Compute an interval $(a,b)$ centered at the mean, such that it contains 80% of the femur lengths of fetus with 25 weeks.\n   Solution  Let $X\\sim N(44,2)$ be the femur length of fetus with 25 weeks of pregnancy.\n $P(X\u0026gt;46)=0.1587$. $P(46\u0026lt;X\u0026lt;49))=0.1524$. The interval centered at $44$ that contains 80% of the femur lengths of fetus with 25 weeks is $(41.4369,46.5631)$.     Question 5 The probability that an injury $A$ is repeated is $4/5$, the probability that another injury $B$ is repeated is $1/2$, and the probability that none of them are repeated is $1/20$. Compute the probability of the following events:\n  At least one injury is repeated.\n  Only injury $B$ is repeated.\n  Injury $B$ is repeated if injury $A$ has been repeated.\n  Injury $B$ is repeated if injury $A$ has not been repeated.\n   Solution   $P(A\\cup B)=19/20$. $P(B\\cap\\overline{A})=3/20$. $P(B/A)=7/16$. $P(B/\\overline{A})=3/4$.     Question 6 A physical therapy clinic opens 6 hours a day and the average number of patients that arrive to the clinic is 12 a day.\n  Compute the probability of arriving more than 4 patients in 1 hour.\n  If the clinic has 4 physiotherapists and each of them can treat one patient per hour, what is the probability that a day there was some hour in which some patient can not be attended? How many physiotherapists must be in the clinic to guarantee that this probability is less than 10%?\n   Solution   Let $X$ be the number of patients that arrive in 1 hours. $X\\sim P(2)$ and $P(X\u0026gt;4)=0.0527$. Let $Y$ be the number of hours in a day in which some patient can not be treated. $Y\\sim B(6, 0.0527)$ and $P(Y\u0026gt;0)=0.2771$.\nThe clinic requires 5 phisiotherapists, since $P(X\u0026gt;5)=0.0527$ and $P(Y\u0026gt;0)=0.0954$, with $Y\\sim B(6, 0.0166)$ now.

The medical team in charge of the trial wants for the test to have a positive predictive value of $0.7$, and a negative predictive value of $0.9$.\n In order to get the values given above, how many of the healthy people should get a positive outcome in the test? And how many of the sick people should get a negative outcome in the test? What is the probability that a person with two positive outcomes in the test has the desase?   Solution  Let $D$ be the event of having the disease.\n $P(+|\\overline{D})=0.0625\\Rightarrow 12.5$ persons. $P(-|D)=0.4165\\Rightarrow 20.825$ persons. $P(D|+\\cap +)=0.9561$.

Was this requirement met during the month of October? Is the value computed representative of the measurements taken during the month of October? The Local Government of Madrid has set speed limits on those days with emissions measurements over 72 ðg/mÂ³; furthermore, there will be additional parking restrictions if the level is over 92 ðg/mÂ³. What percentage of days in October had only speed restrictions? According to the October sample shown, can we say that the distribution of the NOâ emissions in the city of Madrid is normally distributed? Besides the NOâ level, the Municipal Corporation also checks the level of SOâ, and it has found out that the average level of this substance during October was 2.85 ðg/mÂ³, with a standard deviation equa to 0.42 ðg/mÂ³. On a day with an NOâ level of 46, and an SOâ level of 2.24, which level should be considered higher? The Air Quality Index (AQI) is computed by multiplying the NOâ level by 0.95, and adding 30 to the result. What was the average AQI in Madrid during the month of October? Is this value more or less representative than the average NOâ level? Are there outliers in the NOâ emissions in October? Justify your answer.  Use the following data for your computations: $\\sum x_i=1945$ ðg/mÂ³,$\\sum x_i^2=131575$ (ðg/mÂ³)$^2$, $\\sum (x_i-\\bar x)^3=93995.838$ (ðg/mÂ³)Â³ y $\\sum (x_i-\\bar x)^4=7766271.021$ (ðg/mÂ³)â´.\n Solution   $\\bar x=62.7419$ ðg/mÂ³, so the requirement was not met. $s^2=307.8044$ (ðg/mÂ³)Â², $s=17.5444$ ðg/mÂ³, $cv=0.2796$. As the coefficient of variation is less than 0.3 there is a low variability and the mean is quite representative. $F(72)=0.7097$ and $F(92)=0.9161$, so the percentage of days with only speed restrictions is $20.64%$. $g_1=0.5615$ and $g_2=-0.3558$. As both of them are between -2 and 2, we can assume that the emissions are normally distributed. NOâ: $z(46)=-0.9543$. SOâ: $z(2.24)=-1.4524$. Thus, the NOâ emission is relatively higher. Let $y=0.95x+30$ the AQI. $\\bar y=89.6048$, $s_y=16.6671$, $cv=0.186$. As the coeffitient of variation is lower, the AQI mean is more representative. $Q_1=49.5816$ ðg/mÂ³, $Q_3=74.0093$ ðg/mÂ³ and $IQR=24.4277$ ðg/mÂ³.

Therefore, the exponential regression model is better since its coefficient of determination is higher. 2. Exponential regression model of vertigo attacks on time: $y=e^{0.3035 + 0.0099x}$. Number of vertigo attacks expected for 200 min usign electronic gadgets $y(200)=9.8747$. 3. Since the exponential regression model is better than the linear one to predict the number of vertigo attacks as a function of time using electronic gadgets, to predic the time as a function of the number of vertigo attacks is better to use the inverse of the exponential regression model, that is, the logarithmic regression model.

The Spurling test is a test to diagnose cervical radiculopathy with a sensitivity of 95% and a specificity of 93%.\n Compute the positive and negative predictive values of the test and interpret them. Is this test a good test as a screening test (to rule out the disease)? Compute the minimum specificity of the test to be able to diagnose the cervical radiculopathy with a positive outcome.   Solution   $PPV=P(D|+)=0.0455$. $NPV=P(\\overline D|-)=0.9998$. It is a good screening test as the post test probability of not having the cervical radiculopathy for a negative outcome is very high.

Compute the percentage of healthy males with more than 64 of hematocrit.   Solution  Naming $X$ to the hematocrit level in healthy males,\n $\\mu=45.25$ and $\\sigma=10.07$, thus, $X\\sim N(45.25, 10.07)$.\n $P(X\u0026gt;64)=0.0313$, thus, a $3.13$% of healthy males.

If there are 100 professional cyclists doped with EPO in a competition, what is the probability that at least 98 of them had taken some substances to mask the use of EPO? If there are 2000 professional cyclists in a country, what is the probability that some of them has taken EPO without masking it?   Solution   Naming $X$ to the number of cyclists doped with EPO in a team with 10 cyclists, $X\\sim B(10,0.2)$ and $P(X\u0026gt;2)=0.3222$. Naming $Y$ to the number of cyclists that have taken some substances to mask th EPO in 100 cyclists doped with EPO, $Y\\sim B(100,0.99)$ and $P(Y\\geq 98)=0.9206$.

Without motivation you are likely to give up when you face the first learning difficulties or trouble, and there will be for sure. Therefore, you should bear in mind the reasons that made you start this way (especially when you have difficulties). That is, try to walk with an eye in the goal and the other in the path.\nA grade require a lot of effort, but you must think that many people, even with less capabilities than you, have finished it successfully.\nBe proactive This is the big challenge because in primary or secondary school students got used to follow the steps of the teacher, and is the teacher who usually drives the learning process. But higher education is not compulsory and here is the student who has take the initiative driving his/her learning.\nWhat does it mean to be proactive  Explore the subject by yourself. Prepare classes in advance. Try to solve problems by yourself. Expand the information given by the teacher from other sources. Try to apply what you learn to your life or context. Let your curiosity and creativity loose.  The teacher is your ally Unfortunately some times students think about the teacher as a judge or an enemy. But nothing far from true, because the main main purpose of the teacher is to help you in your learning process. You have to change your mind and think about your teacher as your ally. Thus, do not hesitate about ask him or her for help any time you need it.\nMake the most of your classes Classroom sessions are not the only way to learn, but they are one of the most effective. Attend to class just to sign the attendance list could be counterproductive. Thus, if you attend a class, forget about other subjects and try to put all your senses in the topic that the class is about.\nAlso, you need to know how make a proper use of every type of classs. A master class tries to give you a general idea about a topic, highlighting the most important concepts. So, try to save the key ideas and do not worry about the details.\nA seminar, on the other hand, tries to develop a topic in deep. So it is a good idea to prepare the class in advance having a prior look at the topic. This way you can focus on the most difficult aspects of the topic during the class.\nFinally, in a problem-solving workshop its important trying to solve the problems before in order to find out the main difficulties or bottle necks.\nAlso, you should ask your teacher to flip the class.\nWhat is a flipped classroom? The flipped classroom describes a reversal of traditional teaching where students gain first exposure to new material outside of class, usually via reading or lecture videos, and then class time is used to do the harder work of assimilating that knowledge through strategies such as problem-solving, discussion or debates.\nDo not be afraid to ask Related to the previous item, the interaction among the students and between the theacher and the students is essential to take advantage of classes. The teacher can not guess if you have understood a concept or are lost unless you give some feedback to him or her. So, try to overcome your shyness and ask without any fear of ridicule, because most of the time our doubts are gone to be the same for your classmates, and even if not, remember that the only stupid question is the one that you don\u0026rsquo;t ask.\nFeedback is an essential aspect to ensure solid progress in any learning process.\nTake advantage of tutoring One of the main advantages of a private university like this is the availability and closeness of the teachers. If it is clear that the teacher is your ally, you should not hesitate to use tutorials whenever you have a trouble.\nEach student has a personal tutor whose function is to inform and advise him or her and to resolve any academic question that arise, from the course registration until the exams. If you do not know who is your tutor, ask for him or her at the secretariat and arrange an interview with him or her as soon as possible.\nAny time you have a trouble that you do not know how to solve, ask your tutor for help. Even if you do not have any trouble, is a good practice to have regular meetings with your tutor to check the course progress.\nOn the other hand, any subject has its own tutoring hours. Those tutorials are usually at the office of the subject teacher.\nUse tutoring hours for \u0026hellip;\n Getting advise from the teacher about how to face the subject or study a topic. Reviewing concepts that you do not understand (especially if you missed a class). Getting help to solve difficult problems. Reviewing your test or exams.  But \u0026hellip;\n Tutoring hours are not private classes. This means that you have to go to tutorials with a specific doubt or problem and it requires some previous work about the question. Respect the tutoring schedule. Most of the teachers promote tutorials not only to help students, but also because are an effective way to interact with the student and to know each other better. However, the teachers usually have other occupations in addition to teaching. So, in order to not interrupt their work, try not to go to tutorials outside their schedule. If you can not go to a tutorial at that hours, ask the teacher for an appointment.  Read and write Another key for success is to have good documentation that complements what is seen in class. Many students believe that the only important information to consider is that provided by the teacher. But this is a mistake, because the information provided by the teacher is limited, incomplete, and sometimes wrong (unfortunately the teachers commit also mistakes). So, try to complement the class notes with recommended readings, because a good documentation can help you not only to contrast what is seen in class with other sources, but also to understand better what has been explained, and to expand it with new examples, discovering new applications, etc.\nFor each subject you should have two or three reference books. You have some recommendations in the bibliography of the course guides. Have a look to those books (most of them are available at the university library), but if you do not feel comfortable with none of them, ask the teacher for others books or try to find them by yourself on Internet, because each student has to find out his or her book!\nOn the other hand, it is very important, for structuring and settling the main ideas about a subject, writing about it. There is a clear evidence that writing about a subject helps to helps you to organize, clarify and fix the ideas in your mind.\nIs helpful to write summaries and schemas with the key ideas of a class or a topic. Another good practice is to make smalls presentations for every chapter or topic.\nFinally, you should take into account that most assessment tests are written, so writing about the subject is a good training for exams.\nWork in groups Group work is important, not only from the point of view of learning, but also because it helps to develop social habits. In most jobs it is usual to work in teams, since some tasks or problems are simplified and easier to solve working cooperatively. Something similar happens with teaching, since collaborative learning is usually faster and better (and more fun).\nIn this way, working in groups have many advantages:\n Helps you to develop social skills. Reinforce the motivation being part of a team. Enrich the learning with different points of view. Helps to develop a critical reasoning.  But working in group is not easy (especially when somebody does not assume his/her responsibility). Acquiring the skills to work in group requires time and practice, so the sooner you start the better.\nGet organized Review regularly the progress of the course It is important during the course to set some moments to analyze the progress of your work and to review the path travelled and the path ahead. These reviews are intended to make a small self-assessment on the learning process. To what extent the objectives set are being met and if we are being faithful to the guidelines set by this survival manual. Thereby, we can identify the main difficulties in learning and what is failing in order to correct the course in time. In the worst case, if we fail to pass any subject, it is very important to make a final review trying to identify the causes to learn from mistakes not to repeat them in the future. Do not be discouraged and think that even if you have not passed the subject, for sure you have not completely waste your time. Be positive and think about everything you have learned that will undoubtedly provides you a valuable experience for your life.\nReview regularly this tips Finally, do not forget to review and refresh these tips.\n","date":1493018510,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1600206500,"objectID":"7178c1061630403e50e1fc59e98c026d","permalink":"/en/post/survival-guide-for-degrees/","publishdate":"2017-04-24T09:21:50+02:00","relpermalink":"/en/post/survival-guide-for-degrees/","section":"post","summary":"In this post I offer some advice or tips that can help undergraduate students, especially during their first years, to be successful making the most of classes and learning to maximize their work.\n","tags":null,"title":"Survival guide for degrees","type":"post"},{"authors":null,"categories":["Statistics","Biostatistics","Physiotherapy","Medicine"],"content":"Degrees: Physiotherapy, Medicine\nDate: March 31, 2017\nQuestion 1 The table below gives the distribution of points obtained by students in a physiotherapy public competition this year.\n$$ \\begin{array}{|c|r|r|r|r|r|} \\hline x \u0026amp; n_i \u0026amp; x_in_i \u0026amp; x_i^2n_i \u0026amp; (x_i-\\bar x)^3n_i \u0026amp; (x_i-\\bar x)^4n_i\\newline \\hline (0,40] \u0026amp; 84 \u0026amp; 1680 \u0026amp; 33600 \u0026amp; -12155062.50 \u0026amp; 638140781.25\\newline (40,80] \u0026amp; 185 \u0026amp; 11100 \u0026amp; 666000 \u0026amp; -361328.13 \u0026amp; 4516601.56\\newline (80,120] \u0026amp; 72 \u0026amp; 7200 \u0026amp; 720000 \u0026amp; 1497375.00 \u0026amp; 41177812.50\\newline (120,160] \u0026amp; 40 \u0026amp; 5600 \u0026amp; 784000 \u0026amp; 12301875.00 \u0026amp; 830376562.50\\newline (160,200] \u0026amp; 19 \u0026amp; 3420 \u0026amp; 615600 \u0026amp; 23603640.63 \u0026amp; 2537391367.19\\newline \\hline \\sum \u0026amp; 400 \u0026amp; 29000 \u0026amp; 2819200 \u0026amp; 24886500.00 \u0026amp; 4051603125.00\\newline \\hline \\end{array} $$\n Compute the interquartile range and explain your result. Are there outliers in the sample? The minimum number of points to pass the exam is 150; what percentage of students passed the exam?

According to the values of skewness and kurtosis, can we assume that the sample has been taken from a normally distributed population? What score is relatively higher, 150 points in this year exam or 160 in the previous year exam? Justify the answer.   Solution   $Q_1=43.48$ points, $Q_3=97.78$ points and $IQR=54.3$ points. Fences: $F_1=-37.97$ points and $F_2=179.23$ points. Thus, there are outliers. $F_{150}=0.925$, so the percentage of students that passed the exam is $7.5%$. This year: $\\bar x=72.5$ points, $s^2=1791.75$ pointsÂ², $s=42.3291$ points, $cv=0.5838$. Previous year: $\\bar x=80$ points, $s=52$ points, $cv=0.65$. As the coefficient of variation of this year is less than the one of the previous year, there is less relative spread this year and the mean is more representative. $g_1=0.8203$, so the distribution is right-skewed. $g_2=0.1551$, so the distribution is a little bit more peaked than a bell curve (leptokurtic). As $g_1$ and $g_2$ are between -2 and 2 we can assume that the sample has been taken from a normaly distributed population. This year standard score: $z(150)=1.83$. Previous year standard score: $z(160)=1.53$. As the standard score of 150 this year is greater than the standard score of 160 the previous year, 150 points this year is relatively higher than 160 points the previous year.     Question 2 A study try to determine the relation between obesity and the response to pain. The obesity is measured as the percentage over the ideal weight ($X$), and the response to pain with a measure of the twinge sensation. For a sample of 10 individuals we got the following sums:\n$\\sum x_i=737$, $\\sum y_j=77$, $\\sum x_i^2=55589$, $\\sum y_j^2=799.5$, $\\sum x_iy_j=6056.5$\n Compute the linear regression model of the response to pain on the obesity. What is the change in the response to pain for an increment of one point in the weight? What percentage of the variability of the response to pain does not explain the linear regression model? Taking into account the parameters of the exponential model given in the table below, give the equation of the exponential model. Which transformation is required to convert this model into a linear one?  $$ \\begin{array}{lr} \\hline \\mbox{Coefficient} \u0026amp; \\mbox{Estimation}\\newline \\mbox{Intercept} \u0026amp; -1.772\\newline x \u0026amp; 0.049\\newline \\hline \\end{array} \\qquad \\begin{array}{r} \\hline R^2\\newline 0.72\\newline \\hline \\end{array} $$\nWhat is the expected response to pain for an obesity of 50% according to the linear model? And according to the exponential model? Which prediction is more reliable?   Solution   Linear model of response to pain on obesity: $\\bar x=73.7$, $s_x^2=127.21$. $\\bar y=7.7$, $s_y^2=20.66$. $s_{xy}=38.16$ Regression line of pain relief on obesity: $y=-14.41+0.3x$. For each increment of one unit in the obesity the response to pain will increase 0.3 units. Linear coefficient of determination: $r^2=0.554$. So, the linear model explains the 55.4% of the variability of the response to pain and it does not explain the remaining 44.6%. Exponential regression model: $y=e^{-1.772+0.049x}$. To compute this model you have to apply the logarithm to the dependen variable, that is, the response to pain and then compute the regression line of the logarithm of the response to pain on obesity. Prediction with the linear model: $y(50)=0.59$ Prediction with the exponential model: $y(50)=1.9699$ The prediction with the exponential model is better as the exponential coefficient of determination is greater than the linear one.

In which of the two samples is the mean more representative? Justify your answer. Compute the skewness coefficient for both samples; which one is more skewed? What is relatively bigger, a case of 5 pregnancies in sample $A$, or a case of 3 pregnancies in sample $B$?  Consider the following sums for your computations:\n$\\sum a_i=51$, $\\sum a_i^2=199$, $\\sum (a_i-\\bar a)^3=-11.6016$, $\\sum (a_i-\\bar a)^4=217.9954$,\n$\\sum b_i=20$, $\\sum b_i^2=52$, $\\sum (b_i-\\bar b)^3=49.5$, $\\sum (b_i-\\bar b)^4=220.3125$.\n Solution     2. $\\bar a=3.1875$ pregnancies, $s_a^2=2.2773$ pregnanciesÂ², $s_a=1.5091$ pregnancies, $cv_a=0.4734$. $\\bar b=1.25$ pregnancies, $s_b^2=1.6875$ pregnanciesÂ², $s_b=1.299$ pregnancies, $cv_b=1.0392$. As the coefficient of variation of $A$ is less than the coefficient of variation of $B$, the mean of population $A$ is more representative than the mean of population $B$. 3. $g_{1,a}=-0.211$ and $g_{1,b}=1.4113$, so the distribution of $B$ is more skewed than the distribution of $A$. 5. $z_a(5)=1.2011$ and $z_b(3)=1.3472$, so 3 pregnancies is relatively bigger in population $B$ than 5 pregnancies in population $A$.    Question 3 A study to find the relation between the reduction in cholesterol levels in blood and exercise has been carried out. The results are shown in the table below.\n$$ \\begin{array}{lrrrrrrrrrr} \\hline \\mbox{Minutes of exercise} \u0026amp; 96 \u0026amp; 106 \u0026amp; 163 \u0026amp; 207 \u0026amp; 227 \u0026amp; 244 \u0026amp; 261 \u0026amp; 271 \u0026amp; 272 \u0026amp; 301\\newline \\mbox{Cholesterol reduction (mg/dl)} \u0026amp; 4 \u0026amp; 5 \u0026amp; 8 \u0026amp; 13 \u0026amp; 15 \u0026amp; 17 \u0026amp; 22 \u0026amp; 39 \u0026amp; 31 \u0026amp; 45\\newline \\hline \\end{array} $$\n Which regression models explains better the reduction of cholesterol as a function of the exercise time, the linear o the exponential? Justify the answer. According to the linear regression model, how much will be the reduction in cholesterol when the exercise time is increased by one minute? According to the logarithmic model, how much exercise time is needed to get a reduction of cholesterol of 100 mg/dl? Is this estimation reliable? Justify your answer.  Consider the following values for your computations, where $X$=exercise time in minutes, and $Y$=cholesterol reduction: $\\sum x_i=2148$, $\\sum \\log(x_i)=53.0559$, $\\sum y_j=199$, $\\sum \\log(y_j)=27.1766$,\n$\\sum x_i^2=507082$, $\\sum \\log(x_i)^2=282.9578$, $\\sum y_j^2=5779$, $\\sum \\log(y_j)^2=80.035$,\n$\\sum x_iy_j=50750$, $\\sum x_i\\log(y_j)=6359.0468$, $\\sum \\log(x_i)y_j=1097.978$, $\\sum \\log(x_i)\\log(y_j)=147.0682$.\n Solution  1.Linear regression model of cholesterol reduction on exercise time: $\\bar x=214.8$ min, $s_x^2=4569.16$ minÂ². $\\bar y=19.9$ mg/dl, $s_y^2=181.89$ (mg/dl)Â². $s_{xy}=800.48$ minâmg/dl. $r^2 = 0.771$. Exponential regression model of cholesterol reduction on exercise time: $\\overline{\\log(y)}=2.7177$ log(mg/dl), $s_{\\log(y)}^2=0.6178$ log(mg/dl)Â². $s_{x\\log(y)}=52.1504$ minâlog(mg/dl). $r^2 = 0.9635$. Therefore, the exponential regression model is better since its coefficient of determination is higher. 2. Regression line of cholesterol reduction on exercise time: $y=-17.7312 + 0.1752x$. The cholesterol reduction increases 0.1752 mg/dl when the exercise time is increased by one minute. 3. Logarithmic regression model of exercise time on cholesterol reduction: $x=-14.6075 + 84.4135\\log(y)$. $x(100)=374.131$ min. Despite the coefficient of determination is pretty close to 1, the estimation is not reliable since 100 mg/dl is far away from the range of values in the sample.    Probability and random variables Question 4 The medical emergency services of a town gets 6 requests per day in average. This service is staffed with three shifts of 8 hours each.\n Compute the probability of getting more than 3 requests in an 8 hours shift. Compute the probability that in some of the three shifts there are no requests.   Solution   Naming $X$ to the number of requests in an 8 hours shift, $X\\sim P(2)$ and $P(X\u0026gt;3)=0.1429$. Naming $Y$ to the number of shifts with no requests, $Y\\sim B(3,0.1353)$ and $P(Y\u0026gt;0)=0.3535$.     Question 5 The prevalence on certain disease in a population is 10%. A diagnosis test for that disease has a sensitivity of 95% and a specificity of 85%.\n Compute the positive and negative predictive values and explain the result obtained. What is the test more useful for, to detect the disease or to rule it out? What should be the specificity of the test so that the test has a positive predictive value equal to 80%?   Solution   $PPV=P(D|+)=0.413$ and $NPV=P(\\overline D|-)=0.9935$. The specificity should be $97.37%$.     Question 6 In a study of blood pressure on 8000 individuals, it has been recorded that 2254 people show readings of blood pressure above 130 mmHg, and 3126 individuals show readings between 110 and 130 mmHg. Assume that blood pressure is normally distributed.\n Compute the mean and standard deviation (of blood pressure). Readings above 140 mmHg are considered to be a high pressure problem. How many people in the group have such pressure problem? A test will flag a blood pressure problem if the reading of a patient pressure is in the bottom 5% or in the top 5% of the results for the population. For what values of the blood pressure is an individual in the population considered normal?   Solution   Naming $X$ to the blood pressure, $X\\sim N(118.723, 19.5221)$. $P(X\u0026gt;140)=0.1379$ and there are $1103.0473$ persons with high pressure. The blood pressure is normal in the interval $(86.612, 150.8341)$.     Question 7 Students in a Chemistry class need to take two exams in order to pass the subject. The percentage of students that passed the midterm were 60% for the first exam, and 68% for the second. We also have that 80% of the students that passed the first midterm also passed the second midterm. A student from the class is picked randomly.\n Compute the probability that the student has failed both exams. Compute the probability that the student has passed the first exam if we know that she has failed the second exam.   Solution  Naming $E_1$ tho the event of passing the first exam and $E_2$ to the event of passing the second exam:\n $P(\\overline E_1\\cap \\overline E_2)=0.2$. $P(E_1|\\overline E_2)=0.375$.

Compute the standardized points of a student that got 150 points in the MIR.   Solution   $Q_1=43.48$ points, $Q_3=97.78$ points and $IQR=54.3$ points. Fences: $F_1=-37.97$ points and $F_2=179.23$ points.

As the coefficient of variation is greater than 0.5 but not too much there is a moderate variability and the mean is moderately representative. $g_1=0.8203$, so the distribution is right-skewed. $g_2=0.1551$, so the distribution is a little bit more peaked than a bell curve (leptokurtic).
