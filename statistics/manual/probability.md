Descriptive Statistics provides methods to describe the variables measured in the sample and their relations, but it does not allow to draw any conclusion about the population.

Now it is time to take the leap from the sample to the population and the bridge for that is **Probability Theory**.

Remember that the sample has a limited information about the population, and in order to draw valid conclusions for the population the sample must be representative of it. For that reason, to guarantee the representativeness of the sample, this must be drawn randomly. This means that the choice of individuals in the sample is by chance.

Probability Theory will provide us the tools to control the random in the sampling and to determine the level of reliability of the conclusions drawn from the sample.

## Random experiments and events

### Random experiments

The study of a characteristic of the population is conducted through random experiments.

> **Definition - Random experiment**. A *random experiment* is an experiment that meets two conditions:
>
1.  The set of possible outcomes is known.
2.  It is impossible to predict the outcome with absolute certainty.

**Example**. Gambling are typical examples of random experiments. The roll of a dice, for example, is a random experiment because

1.  It is known the set of possible outcomes: $\\\{1,2,3,4,5,6\\\}$.
2.  Before rolling the dice, it is impossible to predict with absolute certainty the outcome.

Another non-gambling example is the random choice of an individual of a human population and the determination of its blood type.

Generally, the draw of a sample by a random method is an random experiment.

### Sample space

> **Defnition - Sample space**. The set $\Omega$ of the possible outcomes of a random experiment is known as the *sample space*.

**Example**. Some examples of sample spaces are:

-   For the toss of a coin $\Omega=$\\\{heads,tails\\\}$.
-   For the roll of a dice $\Omega=\\\{1,2,3,4,5,6\\\}$.
-   For the blood type of an individual drawn by chance $\Omega=\\\{\mbox\{A\},\mbox\{B\},\mbox\{AB\},\mbox\{0\}\\\}$.
-   For the height of an individual drawn by chance $\Omega=\mathbb\{R\}^+$.

### Tree diagrams

In experiments where more than one variable is measured, the determination of the sample space can be difficult. In such a cases, it is advisable to use a **tree diagram** to construct the sample space.

In a tree diagram every variable is represented in a level of the tree and every possible outcome of the variable as a branch.

**Example**. The tree diagram below represents the sample space of a random experiment where the gender and the blood type is mesaured in a random individual.

<img class="img-center" src="img/probability/sample_space.svg" alt="Tree diagram of gender and blood type" width="500">

### Random events

> **Definition - Random event**. A *random event* is any subset of the sample space $\Omega$ of a random experiment.

There are different types of events:

-   **Impossible event:** Is the event with no elements $\emptyset$. It has no chance of occurring.
-   **Elemental events:** Are events with only one element, that is, a singleton.
-   **Composed events:** Are events with two or more elements.
-   **Sure event:** Is the event that contains the whole sample space $\Omega$. It always happens.


## Set theory

### Event space

> **Definition - Event space**. Given a sample space $\Omega$ of a random experiment, the *event space* of $\Omega$ is the set of all possible events of $\Omega$, and is noted $\mathcal{P}(\Omega)$.

**Example**. Given the sample space $\Omega=\\\{a,b,c\\\}$, its even space is

$$\mathcal{P}(\Omega)=\{\emptyset, \{a\},\{b\},\{c\},\{a,b\},\{a,c\},\{b,c\},\{a,b,c\}\}$$

As events are subsets of the sample space, using the set theory we have the following operations on events:

-   Union
-   Intersection
-   Complement
-   Difference

### Union of events

> **Definition - Union event**. Given two events $A,B\subseteq \Omega$, the *union* of $A$ and $B$, denoted by $A\cup B$, is the event of all elements that are members of $A$ or $B$ or both.
>
$$A\cup B = \{x\,|\, x\in A\textrm{ or }x\in B\}.$$

<img class="img-center" src="img/probability/union.svg" alt="Union of two events" width="300">

The union event $A\cup B$ happens when $A$ <span style="color:red;">or</span> $B$ happen.

### Intersection of events

> **Definition - Intersection event**. Given two events $A,B\subseteq \Omega$, the *intersection* of $A$ and $B$, denoted by $A\cap B$, is the event of all elements that are members of both $A$ and $B$.
>
$$A\cap B = \{x\,|\, x\in A\textrm{ and }x\in B\}.$$

<img class="img-center" src="img/probability/intersection.svg" alt="Intersection of two events" width="300">

The intersection event $A\cap B$ happens when $A$ <span style="color:red;">and</span> $B$ happen.

Two events are **incompatible** if their intersection is empty.

### Complement of an event

> **Definition - Complementary event**. Given an event $A\subseteq \Omega$, the *complementary or contrary event* of $A$, denoted by $\bar A$, is the event of all elements of $\Omega$ except the elements that are members of $A$.
>
$$\bar A = \{x\,|\, x\not\in A\}.$$

<img class="img-center" src="img/probability/complement.svg" alt="Complement of an event" width="300">

The complementary event $\bar A$ happens when $A$ does <span style="color:red;">not</span> happen.

### Difference of events

> **Definition - Difference event**. Given two events $A,B\subseteq \Omega$, the *difference* of $A$ and $B$, denoted by $A-B$, is the event of all elements that are members of $A$ but not are members of $B$.
>
$$A-B = \{x\,|\, x\in A\textrm{ and }x\not\in B\} = A \cap \bar B.$$

<img class="img-center" src="img/probability/difference.svg" alt="Diference of two events" width="300">

The difference event $A-B$ happens when $A$ happens but $B$ does not.

**Example**. Given the sample space of rolling a dice $\Omega=\\{1,2,3,4,5,6\\}$ and the events $A=\\{2,4,6\\}$ and $B=\\{1,2,3,4\\}$,

-   The union of $A$ and $B$ is $A\cup B=\\{1,2,3,4,6\\}$.
-   The intersection of $A$ and $B$ is $A\cap B=\\{2,4\\}$.
-   The complement of $A$ is $\bar A=\\{1,3,5\\}$.
-   The events $A$ and $\bar A$ are incompatible.
-   The difference of $A$ and $B$ is $A-B=\\{6\\}$, and the difference of $B$ and $A$ is $B-A=\\{1,3\\}$.

### Algebra of events

Given the events $A,B,C\subseteq \Omega$, the following properties are meet.

1.  $A\cup A=A$, $\quad A\cap A=A$ (idempotency).
2.  $A\cup B=B\cup A$, $\quad A\cap B = B\cap A$ (commutative).
3.  $(A\cup B)\cup C = A\cup (B\cup C)$,
    $\quad (A\cap B)\cap C = A\cap (B\cap C)$ (associative).
4.  $(A\cup B)\cap C = (A\cap C)\cup (B\cap C)$,
    $\quad (A\cap B)\cup C = (A\cup C)\cap (B\cup C)$ (distributive).
5.  $A\cup \emptyset=A$, $\quad A\cap \Omega=A$ (neutral element).
6.  $A\cup \Omega=\Omega$, $\quad A\cap \emptyset=\emptyset$ (absorbing element).
7.  $A\cup \overline A = \Omega$, $\quad A\cap \overline A= \emptyset$ (complementary symmetric element).
8.  $\overline\{\overline A\} = A$ (double contrary).
9.  $\overline\{A\cup B\} = \overline A\cap \overline B$,
    $\quad \overline\{A\cap B\} = \overline A\cup \overline B$ (Morganâ€™s laws).


## Probability definition

### Classical definition of probability

> **Definition - Probability (Laplace)**. Given a sample space $\Omega$ of a random experiment where all elements of $\Omega$ are equally likely, the *probability* of an event $A\subseteq \Omega$ is the quotient between the number of elements of $A$ and the number of elements of $\Omega$
>
$$P(A) = \frac{|A|}{|\Omega|} = \frac{\mbox{number of favorable outcomes}}{\mbox{number of possible outcomes}}$$

This definition is well known, but it has important restrictions:

-   It is required that all the elements of the sample space are equally likely (*equiprobability*).
-   It can not be used with infinite sample spaces.

**Example**. Given the sample space of rolling a dice $\Omega=\\{1,2,3,4,5,6\\}$ and the event $A=\\{2,4,6\\}$, the probability of $A$ is

$$P(A) = \frac{|A|}{|\Omega|} = \frac{3}{6} = 0.5.$$

However, given the sample space of the blood type of a random individual $\Omega=\\{O,A,B,AB\\}$, it is not possible to use the classical definition to compute the probability of having group $A$,

$$P(A) \neq \frac{|A|}{|\Omega|} = \frac{1}{4} = 0.25,$$

because the blood types are not equally likely in human populations.

### Frequency definition of probability

> **Theorem - Law of large numbers**. When a random experiment is repeated a large number of times, the relative frequency of an event tends to the probability of the event.

The following definition of probability uses this theorem.

> **Definition - Frequency probability**. Given a sample space $\Omega$ of a replicable random experiment, the *probability* of an event $A\subseteq \Omega$ is the relative frequency of the event $A$ in an infinite number of repetitions of the experiment
>
$$P(A) = lim_{n\rightarrow \infty}\frac{n_A}{n}$$

Although frequency probability avoid the restrictions of classical definition, it also have some drawbacks

-   It computes an estimation of the real probability (more accurate the higher the sample size).
-   The repetition of the experiment must be in identical conditions.

**Example**. Given the sample space of tossing a coin $\Omega=\\{H,T\\}$, if after tossing the coin 100 times we got 54 heads, then the probability of $H$ is

$$P(H) = \frac{n_H}{n} = \frac{54}{100} = 0.54.$$

Given the sample space of the blood type of a random individual $\Omega=\\{O,A,B,AB\\}$, if after drawing a random sample of 1000 persons we got 412 with blood type $A$, then the probability of $A$ is

$$P(A) = \frac{n_A}{n} = \frac{412}{1000} = 0.412.$$

### Axiomatic definition of probability

> **Definition - Probability (KolmogÃ³rov)**. Given a sample space $\Omega$ of a random experiment, a *probability* function is a function that maps every event $A\subseteq \Omega$ a real number $P(A)$, known as the probability of $A$, that meets the following axioms:

1.  The probability of any event is nonnegative,

    $$P(A)\geq 0.$$
2.  The probability of the sure event is 1,

    $$P(\Omega)=1$$
3.  The probability of the union of two incompatible events ($A\cap B=\emptyset$) is the sum of their probabilities

    $$P(A\cup B) = P(A)+P(B).$$

From the previous axioms is possible to deduce some important properties of a probability function.

Given a sample space $\Omega$ of a random experiment and the events $A,B\subseteq \Omega$, the following properties are meet:

1.  $P(\bar A) = 1-P(A)$.
2.  $P(\emptyset)= 0$.
3.  If $A\subseteq B$ then $P(A)\leq P(B)$.
4.  $P(A) \leq 1$. This means that $P(A)\in [0,1]$.
5.  $P(A-B)=P(A)-P(A\cap B)$.
6.  $P(A\cup B)= P(A) + P(B) - P(A\cap B)$.
7.  If $A=\\{e_1,\ldots,e_n\\}$, where $e_i$ $i=1,\ldots,n$ are elemental events, then

    $$P(A)=\sum_{i=1}^n P(e_i).$$

**Proof.**

1.  $\bar A = \Omega \Rightarrow P(A\cup \bar A) = P(\Omega) \Rightarrow P(A)+P(\bar A) = 1 \Rightarrow P(\bar A)=1-P(A)$.

2.  $\emptyset = \bar \Omega \Rightarrow P(\emptyset) = P(\bar \Omega) = 1-P(\Omega) = 1-1 = 0.$

3.  $B = A\cup (B-A)$. As $A$ and $B-A$ are incompatible, $P(B) = P(A\cup (B-A)) = P(A)+P(B-A) \geq P(A).$

    If we think of probabilities as areas, it is easy to see graphically,

    <img class="img-center" src="img/probability/inclusion_probability.svg" alt="Probability of a event included in other" width="300">

4.  $A\subseteq \Omega \Rightarrow P(A)\leq P(\Omega)=1.$

5.  $A=(A-B)\cup (A\cap B)$. As $A-B$ and $A\cap B$ are incompatible, $P(A)=P(A-B)+P(A\cap B) \Rightarrow P(A-B)=P(A)-P(A\cap B)$.

    If we think of probabilities as areas, it is easy to see graphically,

    <img class="img-center" src="img/probability/difference_probability.svg" alt="Probability of the difference event" width="300">

6.  $A\cup B= (A-B) \cup (B-A) \cup (A\cap B)$. As $A-B$, $B-A$ and $A\cap B$ are incompatible, $P(A\cup B)=P(A-B)+P(B-A)+P(A\cap B) =P(A)-P(A\cap B)+P(B)-P(A\cap B)+P(A\cap B)$ $=P(A)+P(B)-P(A\cup B)$.

    If we think again of probabilities as areas, it is easy to see graphically because the area of $A\cap B$ is added twice (one for $A$ and other for $), so it must be subtracted once.

    <img class="img-center" src="img/probability/union_probability.svg" alt="Probability of the union event" width="300">

7.  $A=\\{e_1,\cdots,e_n\\} = \\{e_1\\}\cup \cdots \cup \\{e_n\\} \Rightarrow P(A)=P(\\{e_1\\}\cup \cdots \cup \\{e_n\\}) =
    P(\\{e_1\\})+ \cdots P(\\{e_n\\}).$


### Probability interpretation

As set by the previous axioms, the probability of an event $A$, is a real number $P(A)$ that always ranges from 0 to 1.

In a certain way, this number expresses the plausibility of the event, that is, the chances that the event $A$ occurs in the experiment. Therefore, it also gives a measure of the uncertainty about the event.

-   The maximum uncertainty correspond to probability $P(A)=0.5$ ($A$ and $\bar A$ have the same chances of happening).
-   The minimum uncertainty correspond to probability $P(A)=1$ ($A$ will happen with absolute certainty) and $P(A)=0$ ($A$ wonâ€™t happen with absolute certainty)

When $P(A)$ is closer to 0 than to 1, the chances of not happening $A$ are greater than the chances of happening $A$. On the contrary, when $P(A)$ is closer to 1 than to 0, the chances of happening $A$ are greater than the chances of not happening $A$.


## Conditional probability

### Conditional experiments

Occasionally, we can get some information about the experiment before its realization. Usually that information is given as an event $B$ of the same sample space that we know that is true before we conduct the experiment.

In such a case, we will say that $B$ is a *conditioning* event and the probability of another event $A$ is known as a *conditional probability* and expressed $P(A\vert B)$. This must be read as *probability of $A$ given $B$* or *probability of $A$ under the condition $B$*.

**Example**. Usually, conditioning events change the sample space and therefore the probabilities of events.

Assume that we have a sample of 100 women and 100 men with the following frequencies

$$
\begin{array}{|c|c|c|}
\hline
 & \mbox{Non-smokers} & \mbox{Smokers} \\ \hline
 \mbox{Females} & 80 & 20 \\ \hline
 \mbox{Males} & 60 & 40 \\ \hline
\end{array}
$$

Then, using the frequency definition of probability, the

$$P(\mbox{Smoker})= \frac{60}{200}=0.3.$$

However, if we know that the person is a woman, then the sample is reduced to the first row, and the probability of being smoker is

$$P(\mbox{Smoker}\mid\mbox{Female})=\frac{20}{100}=0.2.$$


### Conditional probability

> **Definition - Conditional probability** Given a sample space $\Omega$ of a random experiment, and two events $A,B\subseteq \Omega$, the probability of $A$ conditional on $B$ occurring is
>
$$P(A|B) = \frac{P(A\cap B)}{P(B)},$$
>
as long as, $P(B)\neq 0$.

This definition allows to calculate conditional probabilities without changing the original sample space.

**Example**. In the previous example

$$P(\mbox{Smoker}\mid\mbox{Female})= \frac{P(\mbox{Smoker}\cap \mbox{Female})}{P(\mbox{Female})} = \frac{20/200}{100/200}=\frac{80}{100}=0.8.$$


### Probability of the intersection event

From the definition of conditional probability it is possible to derive the formula for the probability of the intersection of two events.

$$P(A\cap B) = P(A)P(B|A) = P(B)P(A|B).$$

**Example**. In a population there are a 30% of smokers and we know that there are a 40% of smokers with breast cancer. The probability of a random person being smoker and having breast cancer is

$$P(\mbox{Smoker}\cap \mbox{Cancer})= P(\mbox{Smoker})P(\mbox{Cancer}\mid\mbox{Smoker}) = 0.3\times 0.4 = 0.12.$$


### Independence of events

Sometimes, the probability of the conditioning event does not change the original probability of the main event.

> **Definition - Independent events**. Given a sample space $\Omega$ of a random experiment, two events $A,B\subseteq \Omega$ are *independents* if the probability of $A$ does not change when conditioning on $B$, and vice-versa, that is,
>
$$P(A|B) = P(A) \quad \mbox{and} \quad P(B|A)=P(B),$$
>
if $P(A)\neq 0$ and $P(B)\neq 0$.

This means that the occurrence of one event does not give relevant information to change the uncertainty of the other.

When two events are independent, the probability of the intersection of them is equal to the product of their probabilities,

$$P(A\cap B) = P(A)P(B).$$

**Example**. The sample space of tossing twice a coin is $\Omega=\\{(H,H),(H,T),(T,H),(T,T)\\}$ and all the elements are equiprobable if the coin is fair. Thus, applying the classical definition of probability we have

$$P((H,H)) = \frac{1}{4} = 0.25.$$

If we name $H_1=\{(H,H),(H,T)\}$, that is, having heads in the first toss, and $H_2=\\{(H,H),(T,H)\\}$, that is, having heads in the second toss, we can get the same result assuming that these events are independent,

$$P(H,H)= P(H_1\cap H_2) = P(H_1)P(H_2) = \frac{2}{4}\frac{2}{4}=\frac{1}{4}=0.25.$$



# Probability Space

> **Definition - Probability space**. A *probability space* of a random experiment is a triplet $(\Omega,\mathcal{F},P)$ where

-   $\Omega$ is the sample space of the experiment.
-   $\mathcal{F}$ is a set of events of the experiment.
-   $P$ is a probability function.

If we know the probabilities of all the elements of $\Omega$, then we can calculate the probability of every event in $\mathcal{F}$ and we can construct easily the probability space.

### Probability space construction

In order to determine the probability of every elemental event we can use a tree diagram, using the following rules:

1.  For every node of the tree, label the incoming edge with the probability of the variable in that level having the value of the node, conditioned by events corresponding to its ancestor nodes in the tree.
2.  The probability of every elemental event in the leaves is the product of the probabilities on edges that go form the root to the leave.

<img class="img-center" src="img/probability/probability_space.svg" alt="Diagram tree of a probability space" width="600">


### Probability tree with dependent variables

In a probability tree with dependent variables, the probababilities of every level of the tree are different depending on the outcome of the previous leves.

**Example**. In a population there are a 30% of smokers and we know that there are a 40% of smokers with breast cancer, while only 10% of non-smokers have breast cancer. The probability tree of the probability space of the random experiment consisting of picking a random person and measuring the variables smoking and breast cancer is shown below.

<img class="img-center" src="img/probability/smoking_cancer_probability_space.svg" alt="Tree diagram of the probability space of smoking and having breast cancer" width="550">


### Probability tree with independent variables

In a probability tree with independent variables, the probabilities of every level of the tree are the same no matter the outcome of the previous leves.

**Example**. The probability tree of the random experiment of tossing two coins is shown below.

<img class="img-center" src="img/probability/coins_probability_space.svg" alt="Tree diagram of the probability space of tossing two coins" width="550">

**Example**. In a population there are 40% of males and 60% of females, the probability tree of drawing a random sample of three persons is shown below.

<img class="img-center" src="img/probability/sample_probability_space.svg" alt="Diagram tree of the probability space of drawing a random sample of three individuals" width="600">



## Total probability theorem

### Partition of the sample space

> **Definition - Partition of the sample space**. A collection of events $A_1,A_2,\ldots,A_n$ of the same sample space $\Omega$ is a *partition* of the sample space if it satisfies the following conditions
>
1.  The union of the events is the sample space, that is, $A_1\cup \cdots\cup A_n =\Omega$.
2.  All the events are mutually incompatible, that is, $A_i\cap A_j = \emptyset$ $\forall i\neq j$.

<img class="img-center" src="img/probability/sample_space_partition.svg" alt="Partition of a sample space" width="300">

Usually it is easy to get a partition of the sample space splitting a population according to some categorical variable, like for example gender, blood type, etc.

### Total probability theorem

If we have a partition of a sample space, we can use it to calculate the probabilities of other events in the same sample space.

> **Theorem - Total probability**. Given a partition $A_1,\ldots,A_n$ of a sample space $\Omega$, the probability of any other event $B$ of the same sample space can be calculated with the formula
>
$$P(B) = \sum_{i=1}^n P(A_i\cap B) = \sum_{i=1}^n P(A_i)P(B|A_i).$$

**Proof**. The proof of the theorem is quite simple. As $A_1,\ldots,A_n$ is a partition of $\Omega$, we have

$$B = B\cap \Omega = B\cap (A_1\cup \cdots \cup A_n) = (B\cap A_1)\cup \cdots \cup (B\cap A_n).$$

And all the events of this union are mutually incompatible as $A_1,\ldots,A_n$ are, thus

$$
\begin{aligned}
P(B) &= P((B\cap A_1)\cup \cdots \cup (B\cap A_n)) = P(B\cap A_1)+\cdots + P(B\cap A_n) =\\
&= P(A_1)P(B|A_1)+\cdots + P(A_n)P(B|A_n) = \sum_{i=1}^n P(A_i)P(B|A_i).
\end{aligned}
$$

<img class="img-center" src="img/probability/total_probability.svg" alt="Graphical proof of the total probability theorem" width="300">

**Example**. A symptom $S$ can be caused by a disease $D$, but it can also be present in persons without the disease. In a population, the rate of people with the disease is $0.2$. We know also that $90\%$ of persons with the disease have the symptom, while only $40\%$ of persons without the disease have it.

*What is the probability that a random person of the population has the symptom?*

To answer the question we can apply the total probability theorem using the partition $\\{A,\bar A\\}$:

$$P(S) = P(D)P(S|D)+P(\bar D)P(S|\bar D) = 0.2\cdot 0.9 + 0.8\cdot 0.4 = 0.5.$$

That is, half of the population has the symptom.

*Indeed, it is a weighted mean of probabilities!*

The answer to the previous question is even clearer with the tree diagram of the probability space.

<img class="img-center" src="img/probability/total_probability_space.svg" alt="Diagram tree of the probability space of a diagnosis experiment" width="550">

$$
\begin{aligned}
P(S) &= P(D,S) + P(\bar D,S) = P(D)P(S|D)+P(\bar D)P(S|\bar D)\\
& = 0.2\cdot 0.9+ 0.8\cdot 0.4 = 0.18 + 0.32 = 0.5.
\end{aligned}
$$


## Bayes theorem

### Bayes theorem

A partition of a sample space $A_1,\cdots,A_n$ may also be interpreted as a set of feasible hypothesis for a fact $B$.

In such cases it may be helpful to calculate the posterior probability $P(A_i\vert B)$ of every hypothesis.

> **Definition - Bayes**. Given a partition $A_1,\ldots,A_n$ of a sample space $\Omega$ and another event $B$ of the same sample space, the conditional probability of every even $A_i$ $i=1,\ldots,n$ on $B$ can be calculated with the following formula
>
$$P(A_i|B) = \frac{P(A_i\cap B)}{P(B)} = \frac{P(A_i)P(B|A_i)}{\sum_{i=1}^n P(A_i)P(B|A_i)}.$$

**Example**. In the previous example, a more interesting question is about the diagnosis for a person with the symptom.

In this case we can interpret $D$ and $\overline{D}$ as the two feasible hypothesis for the symptom $S$. The prior probabilities for them are $P(D)=0.2$ and $P(\overline{D})=0.8$. That means that if we do not have information about the symptom, the diagnosis would be that the person does not have the disease.

However, if after examining the person we observe the symptom, that information changes the uncertainty about the hypothesis, and we need calculate the posterior probabilities to diagnose, that is, $P(D\vert S)$ and $P(\overline{D}\vert S)$.

To calculate the posterior probabilities we can use the Bayes theorem.

$$
\begin{aligned}
P(D|S) &= \frac{P(D)P(S|D)}{P(D)P(S|D)+P(\overline{D})P(S|\overline{D})} = \frac{0.2\cdot 0.9}{0.2\cdot 0.9 + 0.8\cdot 0.4} = \frac{0.18}{0.5}=0.36,\\
P(\overline{D}|S) &= \frac{P(\overline{D})P(S|\overline{D})}{P(D)P(S|D)+P(\overline{D})P(S|\overline{D})} = \frac{0.8\cdot 0.4}{0.2\cdot 0.9 + 0.8\cdot 0.4} = \frac{0.32}{0.5}=0.64.
\end{aligned}
$$

As we can see the probability of having the disease has increased. Nevertheless, the probability of not having the disease is still greater than the probability of having it, and for that reason, the diagnosis is not having the disease.

In this case it is said the the symptom $S$ is *not decisive* in order to diagnose the disease.


## Diagnostic tests

In Epidemiology it is common to use diagnostic test to diagnose diseases.

In general, diagnostic tests are not fully reliable and have some risk of misdiagnosis as it is represented in the table below.

$$
\begin{array}{|l|c|c|}
\hline
 & \mbox{Presence of disease }D & \mbox{Absence of disease }\bar D\\ \hline
\mbox{Test outcome positive } + & \color{green}{ \mbox{True Positive } TP} & \color{red}{\mbox{False
Positive } FP}\\ \hline
\mbox{Test outcome negative } - & \color{red}{\mbox{False Negative } FN} & \color{green}{\mbox{True Negative } TN}\\ \hline
\end{array}
$$

### Sensitivity and specificity of a diagnostic test

The performance of a diagnostic test depends on the following two probabilities.

> **Definition - Sensitivity**. The *sensitivity* of a diagnostic test is the proportion of positive outcomes in persons with the disease
>
$$P(+|D)=\frac{TP}{TP+FN}$$

> **Definition - Specificity**. The *specificity* of a diagnostic test is the proportion of negative outcomes in persons without the disease
>
$$P(-|\overline{D})=\frac{TN}{TN+FP}$$

### Sensitivity and specificity interpretation

Usually, there is a trade-off between sensitivity and specificity.

A test with high sensitivity will detect the disease in most sick persons, but it will produce also more false positives than a less sensitive test. This way, a positive outcome in a test with high sensitivity is not useful for confirming the disease, but a negative outcome is useful for ruling out the disease, since it rarely misdiagnoses those who have the disease.

On the other hand, a test with a high specificity will rule out the disease in most healthy persons, but it will produce also more false negatives than a less specific test. Thus, a negative outcome in a test with high specificity is not useful for ruling out the disease, but a positive is useful to confirm the disease, since it rarely give positive outcomes in healthy people.

Deciding on a test with greater sensitivity or a test with greater specificity depends on the type of disease and the goal of the test. In general, we will use a sensitive test when:

-   The disease is serious and it is important to dectect it.
-   The disease is curable.
-   The false positives do not provoke serious traumas.

An we will use a specific test when:

-   The disease is important but difficult or impossible to cure.
-   The false positives provoke serious traumas.
-   The treatment of false positives can have dangerous consequences.

### Predictive values of a diagnostic test

But the most important aspect of a diagnostic test is its predictive power, that is measured with the following two posterior probabilities.

> **Definition - Positive predictive value $PPV$**. The *positive predictive value* of a diagnostic test is the proportion of persons with the disease to persons with a positive outcome
>
$$P(D|+) = \frac{TP}{TP+FP}$$

> **Definition - Negative predictive value $NPV$**. The *negative predictive value* of a diagnostic test is the proportion of persons without the disease to persons with a negative outcome
>
$$P(\overline{D}|-) = \frac{TN}{TN+FN}$$

Positive and negative predictive values allow to confirm or to rule out the disease, respectively, if they reach at least a threshold of $0.5$.

$$
\begin{array}{rcl}
PPV>0.5 & \Rightarrow & \mbox{Disease diagnostic}\\
NPV>0.5 & \Rightarrow & \mbox{Not disease diagnostic}
\end{array}
$$

However, these probabilities depends on the proportion of persons with the disease in the population $P(D)$ that is known as of the disease. They can be calculated from the sensitivity and the specificity of the diagnostic test using the Bayes theorem.

$$
\begin{aligned}
PPV=P(D|+) &= \frac{P(D)P(+|D)}{P(D)P(+|D)+P(\overline{D})P(+|\overline{D})}\\
NPV=P(\overline{D}|-) &= \frac{P(\overline{D})P(-|\overline{D})}{P(D)P(-|D)+P(\overline{D})P(-|\overline{D})}
\end{aligned}
$$

Thus, with frequent diseases, the positive predictive value increases, and with rare diseases, the negative predictive value increases.

**Example**. A diagnostic test for the flu has been tried in a random sample of 1000 persons. The results are summarized in the table below.

$$
\begin{array}{|l|c|c|}
\hline
& \mbox{Presence of flu } D & \mbox{Absence of flu } \bar D\\ \hline
\mbox{Test outcome } + & 95 & 90 \\
\hline
\mbox{Test outcome }- & 5 & 810 \\
\hline
\end{array}
$$

According to this sample, the prevalence of the flu can be estimated as

$$P(D) = \frac{95+5}{1000} = 0.1.$$

The sensitivity of this diagnostic test is

$$P(+|D) = \frac{95}{95+5}= 0.95.$$

And the specificity is

$$P(-|\overline{D}) = \frac{810}{90+810}=0.9.$$

The predictive positive value of the diagnostic test is

$$PPV = P(D|+) = \frac{95}{95+90} = 0.5135.$$

As this value is over $0.5$, this means that we will diagnose the flu if the outcome of the test is positive. However, the confidence in the diagnostic will be low, as this value is pretty close to $0.5$.

On the other hand, the predictive negative value is

$$NPV = P(\overline{D}|-) = \frac{810}{5+810} = 0.9939.$$

As this value is almost 1, that means that is almost sure that a person does not have the flu if he or she gets a negative outcome in the test.

Thus, this test is a powerful test to rule out the flu, but not so powerful to confirm it.


### Likelihood ratios of a diagnostic test

The following measures are usually derived from sensitivity and specificity.

> **Definition - Positive likelihood ratio $LR+$**. The *positive likelihood ratio* of a diagnostic test is the ratio between the probability of positive outcomes in persons with the disease and healthy persons respectively,
>
$$LR+=\frac{P(+|D)}{P(+|\overline{D})} = \frac{\mbox{Sensitivity}}{1-\mbox{Specificity}}$$

> **Definition - Negative likelihood ratio $LR-$**. The *negative likelihood ratio* of a diagnostic test is the ratio between the probability of negative outcomes in persons with the disease and healthy persons respectively,
>
$$LR-=\frac{P(-|D)}{P(-|\overline{D})} = \frac{1-\mbox{Sensitivity}}{\mbox{Specificity}}$$

Positive likelihood ratio can be interpreted as the number of times that a positive outcome is more probable in people with the disease than in people without it.

On the other hand, negative likelihood ratio can be interpreted as the number of times that a negative outcome is more probable in people with the disease than in people without it.

Post-test probabilities can be calculated from pre-test probabilities through likelihood ratios.

$$P(D|+) = \frac{P(D)P(+|D)}{P(D)P(+|D)+P(\overline{D})P(+|\overline{D})} = \frac{P(D)LR+}{1-P(D)+P(D)LR+}$$

Thus,

-   A likelihood ratio greater than 1 increases the probability of disease.
-   A likelihood ratio less than 1 decreases the probability of disease.
-   A likelihood ratio 1 does not change the pre-test probability.
