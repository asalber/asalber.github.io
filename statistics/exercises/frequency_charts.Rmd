## Exercise 7
The following table represents the frequency distribution of the yearly uses of a health insurance in a sample of clients of a insurance company.

uses <- c(0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7)
clients <- c(4, 8, 6, 3, 2, 1, 1)
data <- data.frame(uses,clients)
x <- rep(uses,clients)
kable(data)
```

Draw the box plot. Study the symmetry of the distribution.

<div><button class="solution">Show solution</button></div>

## Exercise 8
The box plots below correspond to the age of a sample of people by marital status.

```{r ages_marital_status_boxplot}
status=c("S","S","S","S","S","S","S","S","S","D","D","D","D","D","D","W","W","W","W","W","W","W","M","M","M","M","M")
age=c(31,45,45,35,21,38,62,32,31,62,34,52,59,69,62,80,68,65,40,78,69,75,31,65,59,51,71)
#par(cex.lab=1.2)
boxplot(age~status, main="Boxplot of Ages by Marital Status", xlab="Age",col=rainbow(4,s=0.6), horizontal=TRUE)
```

1.  Which group has higher ages?
2.  Which group has lower central dispersion?
3.  Which groups have outliers?
4.  At which group is the age distribution more asymmetric?
