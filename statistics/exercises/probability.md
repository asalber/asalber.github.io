## Exercise 11
In a digestive clinic from every 1000 patients that arrive with stomach pain, 700 have gastritis, 200 have an ulcer and 100 have cancer. After analyzing the gastric symptoms, it is known that the probability of having vomiting is $0.3$ in case of gastritis, $0.6$ in case of ulcer and $0.9$ in case of cancer. What is the diagnosis for a new patient with stomach pain that has vomiting?

Note: Assume that the only diseases are gastritis, ulcer and cancer and that are incompatible among them.

<div><button class="solution">Show solution</button></div>
<div id="solution" style="display: none">
Naming $G$, $U$ and $C$ to the events of having gastritis, ulcer and cander respectively, and $V$ to the event of having vomiting, $P(G/V)=0.5$, $P(U/V)=0.286$ and $P(C/V)=0.214$, so, the diagnosis is gastritis.

## Exercise 12


A severe pain without effusion in a particular zone of the knee joint is a symptom of sprained lateral collateral ligament (SLCL). If the sprains in that ligament are classified into grade 1, when there is only distension (60% of cases), grade 2 when there is a partial tearing (30% of cases) and grade 3 when there is a complete tearing (10% of cases). Taking into account that the symptom appears in 80% of cases of grade 1 sprains, 90% of cases of grade 2 and 100% of cases of grade 3, answer the following questions:

1.  If a person has SLCL what is the probability that he or she present severe pain without effusion?
2.  What is the diagnosis for a person with severe pain without effusion?
3.  From a total of 10000 people with severe pain without effusion, how many are expected to have a grade 1 sprain? How many are expected to have a grade 2 sprain? And a grade 3 sprain?

<div><button class="solution">Show solution</button></div>
<div id="solution" style="display: none">
Naming $S$ to the event of presenting severe pain without effusion, and $G1$, $G2$ and $G3$ to the events of having a SLCL of grade 1, 2 and 3 respectively, <br/>
1. $P(S)=0.85$. <br/>
2. $P(G1\vert S)=0.5647$, $P(G2\vert S)=0.3176$ and $P(G3\vert S)=0.1176$, so the diagnosis is a SLCL of grade 1. <br/>
3. $5647.0588$ will have a grade 1 sprain, $3176.4706$ will have a grade 2 sprain and $1176.4706$ will have a grade 3 sprain.

## Exercise 13
A physiotherapist uses two techniques $A$ and $B$ to cure an injury. It is known that the injury is 3 times more frequent in people over 30 than in people under 30. It is also known that in people over 30 technique $A$ works in 30% of cases and technique $B$ in 60%, while in people under 30 technique $A$ works in 50% of cases and technique $B$ in 70%. If both techniques are applied with the same probability, no matter the age,

1.  What is the probability that a random person under 30 is cured? And for a people over 30?
2.  What is the probability that a random person is cured?
3.  If after applying a technique to a person over 30, the person doesn’t cure, what is the probability that the technique applied was $A$?

<div><button class="solution">Show solution</button></div>
<div id="solution" style="display: none">
Naming $J$ to the event of being under 30, $C$ to the event of being cured, and $A$ and $B$ to the events of applying techniques $A$ and $B$ respectively, <br/>
