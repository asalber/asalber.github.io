## Exercise 1
Construct the sample space of the following random experiments:

1.  Pick a random person and measure the gender and whether she or he is smoker or not.
2.  Pick a random person and measure the blood type and whether she or he is smoker or not.
3.  Pick a random person and measure the gender, the blood type and whether she or he is smoker or not.


## Exercise 2 
There are two boxes with balls of different colors. The first box contains 3 white balls and 2 black balls, and the second one contains 2 blue balls, 1 red ball and 1 green ball. Construct the sample space of the following random experiments:

1.  Pick a random ball from every box.
2.  Pick two random balls from every box.

## Exercise 3
The Morgan’s laws state that given two events $A$ and $B$ from the same sample space, $\overline{A\cup B}=\bar A \cap \bar B$ and $\overline{A\cap B}=\bar A \cup \bar B$. Proof both statements graphically using Venn diagrams.

## Exercise 4
Calculate the probability of the following events of the random experiment consisting in tossing 3 coins:

1.  Get exactly 1 heads.
2.  Get exactly 2 tails.
3.  Get two or more heads.
4.  Get some tails.

<div><button class="solution">Show solution</button></div>
<div id="solution" style="display: none">
1. $P(\mbox{1 heads})=0.375$. <br/>
2. $P(\mbox{2 tails})=0.375$. <br/>
3. $P(\mbox{2 or more heads})=0.5$. <br/>
4. $P(\mbox{some tails})=0.875$.
</div>

## Exercise 5
In a laboratory there are 4 flasks with sulfuric acid and 2 with nitric acid, and in another laboratory there are 1 flask with sulfuric acid and 3 with nitric acid. A random experiment consist in picking two flask, one from every laboratory. Calculate the probability of the following events:

1.  The two picked flasks are of sulfuric acid.

2.  The two picked flasks are of nitric acid.

3.  The tow picked flasks contains different acids.

Calculate the same probabilities if the flask picked in the first laboratory is put in the second laboratory before picking the flask from it.

## Exercise 6
Let $A$ and $B$ be events of the same sample space, such that $P(A)=3/8$, $P(B)=1/2$, $P(A\cap B)=1/4$. Calculate the following probabilities:

1.  $P(A\cup B)$.
2.  $P(\bar A)$ y $P(\bar B)$.
3.  $P(\bar A\cap \bar B)$.
4.  $P(A\cap \bar B)$.
5.  $P(A&#124;B)$.
6.  $P(A\vert B)$.

## Exercise 7
In a hospital the probability of getting hepatitis in a blood transfusion from a unit of blood is $0.01$. A patient gets two units of blood while staying at the hospital. What is the probability of getting hepatitis?

## Exercise 8
Let $A$ and $B$ be two events of the same sample space, such that $P(A)=0.6$ and $P(A\cup B)=0.9.$ Calculate $P(B)$ with the following assumptions:

1.  $A$ and $B$ are incompatible.
2.  $A$ and $B$ are independent.

## Exercise 9
A study about smoking has published that 40% of smokers have a smoker father, 25% have a smoker mother and 52% have al least one of the parents smoker. We pick a random person from this population. Answer the following questions:

1.  What is the probability of having a smoker mother if the father smokes?
2.  What is the probability of having a smoker mother if the father doesn’t smoke?
3.  Are independent the events having a smoker father and having a smoker mother?

## Exercise 10
The probability that an injury $A$ is repeated is $4/5$, the probability that another injury $B$ is repeated is $1/2$, and the probability that both injuries are repeated is $1/3$. Calculate the probability of the following events:

1.  Only injury $B$ is repeated.
2.  At least one injury is repeated.
3.  Injury $B$ is repeated if injury $A$ has been repeated.
4.  Injury $B$ is repeated if injury $A$ hasn’t been repeated.

## Exercise 11
In a digestive clinic from every 1000 patients that arrive with stomach pain, 700 have gastritis, 200 have an ulcer and 100 have cancer. After analyzing the gastric symptoms, it is known that the probability of having vomiting is $0.3$ in case of gastritis, $0.6$ in case of ulcer and $0.9$ in case of cancer. What is the diagnosis for a new patient with stomach pain that has vomiting?

Note: Assume that the only diseases are gastritis, ulcer and cancer and that are incompatible among them.
