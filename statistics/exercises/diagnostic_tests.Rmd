## Exercise 1
To evaluate the effectiveness of a diagnosis test, the test was applied to a sample of people with the following results:

|         | Test $+$   | Test $-$   |
|:--------|:----------:|:----------:|
| Sick    |    2020    |     80     |
| Healthy |     140    |    7760    |

Calculate for this test:

1.  The sensibility and the specificity.
2.  The positive and negative predictive value.
3.  The probability of a correct diagnosis.

## Exercise 2
We know, from a research study, that 10% of people over 50 years suffer a particular type or arthritis. We have developed a new method to detect the disease and after clinical trials we observe that if we apply the method to people with arthritis we get a positive result in 85% of cases, while if we apply the method to people without arthritis, we get a positive result in 4% of cases. Answer the following questions:

1.  What is the probability of getting a positive result after applying the method to a random person?
2.  If the result of applying the method to one person has been positive, what is the probability of having arthritis?

## Exercise 3
A severe pain without effusion in a particular zone of the knee joint is a symptom of sprained lateral collateral ligament (SLCL). If the sprains in that ligament are classified into grade 1, when there is only distension (60% of cases), grade 2 when there is a partial tearing (30% of cases) and grade 3 when there is a complete tearing (10% of cases). Taking into account that the symptom appears in 80% of cases of grade 1 sprains, 90% of cases of grade 2 and 100% of cases of grade 3, answer the following questions:

1.  If a person has SLCL what is the probability that he or she present severe pain without effusion?
2.  What is the diagnosis for a person with severe pain without effusion?
3.  From a total of 10000 people with severe pain without effusion, how many are expected to have a grade 1 sprain? How many are expected to have a grade 2 sprain? And a grade 3 sprain?

## Exercise 4
A physiotherapist uses two techniques $A$ and $B$ to cure an injury. It is known that the injury is 3 times more frequent in people over 30 than in people under 30. It is also known that in people over 30 technique $A$ works in 30% of cases and technique $B$ in 60%, while in people under 30 technique $A$ works in 50% of cases and technique $B$ in 70%. If both techniques are applied with the same probability, no matter the age,

1.  What is the probability of a random person under 30 to cure? And for a people over 30?
2.  What is the probability of a random person to cure?
3.  If after applying a technique to a person over 30, the person doesnâ€™t cure, what is the probability that the technique applied was $A$?

## Exercise 5
We have two different test $A$ and $B$ to diagnose a disease. Test $A$ have a sensitivity of 98% and a specificity of 80%, while test $B$ have a sensitivity of 75% and a specificity of 99%.

1.  What test is better to confirm the disease?
2.  What test is better to rule out the disease?
3.  Often a test is used to discard the presence of the disease in a large amount of people apparently healthy. This type of test is known as *screening test*. What test will work better as a screening test? What are the predictive values (PPV) of this test if the prevalence of the disease is $0.01$? And if the prevalence of de disease is $0.2$?
4.  The positive predictive value of a screening test used to be not too high. How can combine tests $A$ and $B$ to have a higher confidence in the diagnosis of the disease? Calculate the post-test probability of having the disease with the combination of both tests if the outcome of both test is positive for a prevalence of $0.01$.
