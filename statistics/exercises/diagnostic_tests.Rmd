## Exercise 1
```{r}
pe = 2020
ps = 140
ne = 80
ns = 7760
```

To evaluate the effectiveness of a diagnosis test, the test was applied to a sample of people with the following results:

$$
\begin{array}{l|cc}
& \mbox{Test }+ & \mbox{Test }- \\
\hline
\mbox{Sick} & 2020 & 80 \\

\mbox{Healthy} & 140 & 7760 \\
\end{array}
$$

Calculate for this test:

1.  The sensitivity and the specificity.
2.  The positive and negative predictive value.
3.  The probability of a correct diagnosis.

<div id="solution" style="display: none">
Naming $S$ and $H$ to the events of being sick and healthy respectively, <br/>
1. Sensitivity $P(+\vert S)=`r pe/(pe+ps)`$ and specificity $P(-\vert H)=`r ns/(ne+ns)`$. <br/>
2. PPV $P(S\vert +)=`r pe/(pe+ne)`$ and NPV $P(H\vert -)=`r ns/(ps+ns)`$. <br/>
3. $P((S\cap +)\cup (H\cap -)) = P(S\cap +) + P(H\cap -) = `r (pe+ns)/(pe+ps+ne+ns)`$. 
</div>


## Exercise 2
```{r}
pre = 0.1
sen = 0.85
spe = 0.96
pos = pre*sen+(1-pre)*(1-spe)
```

We know, from a research study, that `r pre*100`% of people over 50 suffer a particular type or arthritis. We have developed a new method to detect the disease and after clinical trials we observe that if we apply the method to people with arthritis we get a positive result in `r sen*100`% of cases, while if we apply the method to people without arthritis, we get a positive result in `r (1-spe)*100`% of cases. Answer the following questions:

1.  What is the probability of getting a positive result after applying the method to a random person?
2.  If the result of applying the method to one person has been positive, what is the probability of having arthritis?

<div><button class="solution">Show solution</button></div>
<div id="solution" style="display: none">
Naming $A$ to the event of having arthritis, <br/>
1. $P(+)=`r pos`$. <br/>
2. $P(A\vert +) = `r pre*sen/pos`$.
</div>

## Exercise 3
```{r}
senA = 0.98
speA = 0.8
senB = 0.75
speB = 0.99
pre1 = 0.01
pre2 = 0.2
posA1 = pre1*senA+(1-pre1)*(1-speA)
posA2 = pre2*senA+(1-pre2)*(1-speA)
ppv1 = pre1*senA/posA1
npv1 = (1-pre1)*speA/(1-posA1)
ppv2 = pre2*senA/posA2
npv2 = (1-pre2)*speA/(1-posA2)
```

We have two different test $A$ and $B$ to diagnose a disease. Test $A$ have a sensitivity of `r senA*100`% and a specificity of `r speA*100`%, while test $B$ have a sensitivity of `r senB*100`% and a specificity of `r speB*100`%.

1.  What test is better to confirm the disease?
2.  What test is better to rule out the disease?
3.  Often a test is used to discard the presence of the disease in a large amount of people apparently healthy. This type of test is known as *screening test*. What test will work better as a screening test? What are the predictive values of this test if the prevalence of the disease is `r pre1`? And if the prevalence of de disease is `r pre2`?
4.  The positive predictive value of a screening test used to be not too high. How can combine tests $A$ and $B$ to have a higher confidence in the diagnosis of the disease? Calculate the post-test probability of having the disease with the combination of both tests if the outcome of both test is positive for a prevalence of `r pre1`.

<div><button class="solution">Show solution</button></div>
<div id="solution" style="display: none">
1. Test $B$ cause it has a greater specificity. <br/>
2. Test $A$ cause it has a greater sensitivity. <br/>
3. Test $A$ will perform better as a screening test. <br/>
For a prevalence of $`r pre1`$ the PPV is $P(D\vert +)=`r ppv1`$ and the NPV is $P(\bar D\vert -)=`r npv1`$. <br/>
For a prevalence of $`r pre2`$ the PPV is $P(D\vert +)=`r ppv2`$ and the NPV is $P(\bar D\vert -)=`r npv2`$. <br/>
4. First applying test $A$ to everybody and then applying test $B$ to positive cases of test $A$. <br/>
$P(D\vert +_A\cap +_B)=`r ppv1*senB/(ppv1*senB+(1-ppv1)*(1-speB))`$.
