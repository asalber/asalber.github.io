The following table represents the frequency distribution of ages at
which a group of people suffered a heart attack.

  --------- ---------- ---------- ---------- ---------- ----------
  Age        \[40-50)   \[50-60)   \[60-70)   \[70-80)   \[80-90)
  Persons       6          12         23         19         5

Could we assume that the sample comes from a normal population?

Use the following sums: $\sum x_i= 4275$ years,
$\sum (x_i-\bar x)^2=7462$ years$^2$, $\sum (x_i-\bar x)^3=-18249$
years$^3$, $\sum (x_i-\bar x)^4=2099636$ years$^4$.

To compare two rehabilitation treatments $A$ and $B$ for an injury,
every treatment was applied to a different group of people. The number
of days required to cure the injury in every group is shown in the
following table:

  -------- ----- -----
  Days       $A$   $B$
  20-40        5     8
  40-60       20    15
  60-80       18    20
  80-100       7     7
  -------- ----- -----

1.  In which treatment is more representative the mean?

2.  In which treatment the distribution of days is more skew?

3.  In which treatment the distribution is more peaked?

Use the following sums:\
$A$: $\sum x_i= 3040$ days, $\sum (x_i-\bar x)^2=14568$ days$^2$,
$\sum (x_i-\bar x)^3=17011.2$ days$^3$, $\sum
(x_i-\bar x)^4=9989603$ days$^4$\
$B$: $\sum x_i= 3020$ days, $\sum (x_i-\bar x)^2=16992$ days$^2$,
$\sum (x_i-\bar x)^3=-42393.6$ days$^3$, $\sum
(x_i-\bar x)^4=12551516$ days$^4$\

The systolic blood pressure (in mmHg) of a sample of persons is
$$135\quad 128\quad 137\quad 110\quad 154\quad 142\quad 121\quad 127\quad 114\quad 103$$

1.  Calculate the central tendency statistics.

2.  How is the relative dispersion with respect to the mean?

3.  How is the skewness of the sample distribution?

4.  How is the kurtosis of the sample distribution?

5.  If we know that the method used for measuring the blood pressure is
    biased, and, in order to get the right values, we have to apply the
    linear transformation $y=1.2x-5$, which are values of the statistics
    required to answer the previous questions for the corrected values
    of the blood pressure?

Use the following sums: $\sum x_i= 1271$ mmHg,
$\sum (x_i-\bar x)^2=2188.9$ mmHg$^2$, $\sum (x_i-\bar x)^3=2764.32$
mmHg$^3$, $\sum (x_i-\bar x)^4=1040080$ mmHg$^4$.

1.  How many birth outliers are in the sample?

2.  Which variable has lower spread with respect to the mean?

3.  Which value is relatively higher, 7 pregnancies or 4 abortions?
    Justify the answer.

Use the following sums:\
Pregnancies: $\sum x_i= 2783$, $\sum x_i^2=9773$.\
Abortions: $\sum x_i= 333$, $\sum x_i^2=559$.\
Births: $\sum x_i= 2450$, $\sum x_i^2=7370$.
