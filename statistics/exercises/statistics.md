## Exercise 7
To compare two rehabilitation treatments $A$ and $B$ for an injury, every treatment was applied to a different group of people. The number of days required to cure the injury in each group is shown in the
following table:


|Days   |  A|  B|

|20-40  |  5|  8|
|40-60  | 20| 15|

## Exercise 8
The systolic blood pressure (in mmHg) of a sample of persons is 

```
135 128 137 110 154 142 121 127 114 103
```

1.  Calculate the central tendency statistics.
2.  How is the relative dispersion with respect to the mean?
3.  How is the skewness of the sample distribution?
4.  How is the kurtosis of the sample distribution?
5.  If we know that the method used for measuring the blood pressure is biased, and, in order to get the right values, we have to apply the linear transformation $y=1.2x-5$, what are the statistics values of parts (a) to (d) for the new, corrected distribution?
