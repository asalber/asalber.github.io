It is known that in a population the sural triceps elongation follows has mean 60 cm and standard deviation 15 cm. If you draw a sample of 30 individuals from this population, what is the probability of having a sample mean greater than 62 cm? If a sample is atypical if its mean is below the 5th percentile, is atypical a sample of 60 individuals with $\bar x=57$?


## Exercise 14
The curing time of a knee injury in soccer players follows a normal distribution model with mean 50 days and standard deviation 10 days. If there is a final match in 65 days, what is the probability that a player that has just injured his knee will miss the final? If the semifinal match is in 40 days, and 4 players has just injured the knee, what is the probability that some of them can play the semifinal?
