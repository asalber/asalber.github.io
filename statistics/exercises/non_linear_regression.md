## Exercise 1
A dietary center is testing a new diet in sample of 12 persons. The data below are the number of days of diet and the weight loss (in kg) until them for every person.

```
(33,3.9)  (51,5.9)  (30,3.2)  (55,6)  (38,4.9)  (62,6.2)  (35,4.5)  (60,6.1)  (44,5.6)  (69,6.2)  (47,5.8)  (40,5.3) 
```

1. Draw the scatter plot. According to the point cloud, what type of regression model explains better the relation between the weight loss and the days of diet?
2. Construct the linear regression model and the logarithmic regression model of the weight loss on the number of days of diet.
3. Use the best model to predict the weight that will lose a person after 40 and 100 days of diet. Are these predictions reliable?

Use the following sums ($X$=days of diet and $Y$=weight loss):
$\sum x_i=564$ days, $\sum \log(x_i)=45.8086$ $\log(\mbox{days})$, $\sum y_j=63.6$ kg, $\sum x_i^2=28234$ days$^2$, $\sum \log(x_i)^2=175.6603$ $\log(\mbox{days})^2$, $\sum y_j^2=347.7$ kg$^2$, $\sum x_iy_j=3108.5$ days$\cdot$kg, $\sum \log(x_i)y_j=245.4738$ $\log(\mbox{days})\cdot$kg.
