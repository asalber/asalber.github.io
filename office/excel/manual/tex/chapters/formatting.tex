\chapter{Formatting data}

Content of cells can be formatted in many ways: changing the data type, the font family, the alignment, the color, the
border, etc. Most formatting options are grouped in the \emph{Format Cells} dialog. To show this dialog click the bottom
right corner of the Font panel in the ribbon's Home tab.

\section{Data types}\hypertarget{data-types}{}\label{data-types}

Excel manages several data types. The most common are numbers, dates and times, and text. All available data types are
in the \texttt{Number tab} of the Format Cells dialog (see figure~\ref{img-number_dialog}).

\begin{figure}[htbp]

\label{img-number_dialog}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Formatting numbers}\hypertarget{formatting-numbers}{}\label{formatting-numbers}

By default cells with numeric content are of type \emph{Number}, but there are other numeric types like \emph{Currency}
and \emph{Accounting}. Number is used for general display of numbers, while Currency and Accounting are used for
monetary values. In all cases you can specify the number of decimal places. For monetary values you can also specify the
symbol for the currency (\euro\ by default).

\textbf{Example}. The table in this \href{http://aprendeconalf.es/office/excel/manual/img/example_number_format.gif}{animation} shows the price of fruits during several months and the average price. The animation shows how to change the format of prices to currency type with 3 decimal places.

\subsection{Formatting dates and times}\hypertarget{formatting-dates-and-times}{}\label{formatting-dates-and-times}

By default cells with content following the pattern \texttt{day/month/year} are of type \emph{Date}, but there are a lot of ways of formatting dates, like for example, \texttt{year-month-day} or \texttt{day-month\_name-year} etc.

\textbf{Example}. The table in this \href{http://aprendeconalf.es/office/excel/manual/img/example_date_format.gif}{animation} shows the price of fruits during several months and the average price. The animation shows how to change the format of dates following the pattern Month-Year, with the three first letters of months and the two last digits of years.

By default cells with content following the pattern \texttt{hours:minutes:seconds} are of type \emph{Time}, but there are a several ways of formatting times.

\subsection{Formatting text}\hypertarget{formatting-text}{}\label{formatting-text}

By default cells with non numeric content are of type \emph{Text}. It's possible to apply this type even to numbers, like for example phone numbers.

Text entered in a cell spreads to adjacent cells to the right if these cells have no content. To confine text to a certain width in the cell, select the cell and click the button \texttt{Wrap Text} in the Alignment section in the ribbon's Home tab.

\section{Align cell contents}\hypertarget{align-cell-contents}{}\label{align-cell-contents}

By default numbers are aligned to the right and text to the left, but it's possible to change the alignment of cell
contents in the \texttt{Alignment tab} of the Format Cells dialog (see figure~\ref{img-alignment_dialog}).

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\begin{center}

\section{Conditional formatting}\hypertarget{conditional-formatting}{}\label{conditional-formatting}

Excel allows to apply a format to a cell depending on its value and according to some rules. To set a new rule click the
\texttt{Conditional Formatting} button and select \texttt{New Rule}. There are different types of rules:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Format all cells based on their value} Applies a format style based on the value of the cell. There are 4 types of styles:


\begin{itemize}
\item \emph{2-Color Scale} Applies a colour in a continuous scale ranging from one colour for the minimum value or percentage to other colour for the maximum value or percentage.

\textbf{Example}. The table in this \href{http://aprendeconalf.es/office/excel/manual/img/example_conditional_formatting_colour_scale.gif}{animation} shows the price of fruits during several months and the average price. The animation shows how to apply to prices a colour background in a continuous scale from green (the minimum price) to red (the maximum price).
\item \emph{3-Color Scale} The same than 2-Color Scale but with a third intermediate colour in the scale.
\item \emph{Data bar} Plots an horizontal bar in each cell with a length proportional to the value of the cell.

\textbf{Example}. The table in this \href{http://aprendeconalf.es/office/excel/manual/img/example_conditional_formatting_data_bar.gif}{animation} shows the price of fruits during several months and the average price. The animation shows how to apply to prices a data bar format.
\item \emph{Icon Sets} Divide the distribution of selected cell values in several parts according to intervals or percentiles, assign an different icon to each part, and plot the corresponding icon in each cell.

\textbf{Example}. The table in this \href{http://aprendeconalf.es/office/excel/manual/img/example_conditional_formatting_icon_set.gif}{animation} shows the price of fruits during several months and the average price. The animation shows how to apply to prices an icon set format. The icon set has three icons: red is applied to values under the 33 percentile, yellow is applied to values between 33 and 67 percentiles, and green is applied to values over 67 percentile.
\end{itemize}
\item \textbf{Format only cells that contain} Applies a format to the cell if satisfies a logical condition.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Example}. The table in this \href{http://aprendeconalf.es/office/excel/manual/img/example_conditional_formatting_logical_condition.gif}{animation} shows the price of fruits during several months and the average price. The animation shows how to apply to prices higher than 2 â¬ a red colour.

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Format only top or bottom ranked values} Applies a format to a number or percentage of top or bottom values.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Example}. The table in this \href{http://aprendeconalf.es/office/excel/manual/img/example_conditional_formatting_top_values.gif}{animation} shows the price of fruits during several months and the average price. The animation shows how to apply to the three top higher prices a red colour.

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Format only values that are above or below average} Applies a format to cells with values above or below the average of selected cells.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Example}. The table in this \href{http://aprendeconalf.es/office/excel/manual/img/example_conditional_formatting_average.gif}{animation} shows the price of fruits during several months and the average price. The animation shows how to apply a red colour to prices above the average and a green colour to prices below the average.

\section{Predefined styles}\hypertarget{predefined-styles}{}\label{predefined-styles}

Excel has a lot of predefined styles for formatting cells and tables. To apply a predefined cell style click
\texttt{Cell Styles} button and select the desired style. It's possible to define new cell styles. For that select the
