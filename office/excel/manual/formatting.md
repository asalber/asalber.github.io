Content of cells can be formatted in many ways: changing the data type, the font family, the alignment, the color, the border, etc. Most formatting options are grouped in the *Format Cells* dialog. To show this dialog click the bottom right corner of the Font panel in the Home tab of the ribbon.

## Data types
Excel manages several data types. The most common are numbers, dates and times, and text. All available data types are in the `Number tab` of the Format Cells dialog.

</div>
<br/>


### Formatting numbers
By default cells with numeric content are of type *Number*, but there are other numeric types like *Currency* and *Accounting*. Number is used for general display of numbers, while Currency and Accounting are used for monetary values. In all cases you can specify the number of decimal places. For monetary values you can also specify the symbol for the currency (â‚¬ by default). 

**Example**. The next table shows the price of fruits during several months and the average price. The animation shows how to change the format of prices to currency type with 3 decimal places.

</div>
<br/>


### Formatting dates and times
By default cells with content following the pattern `day/month/year` are of type *Date*, but there are a lot of ways of formatting dates, like for example, `year-month-day` or `day-month_name-year` etc. 

**Example**. The next table shows the price of fruits during several months and the average price. The animation shows how to change the format of dates following the pattern Month-Year, with the three first letters of months and the two last digits of years. 

<div style="text-align:center">

</div>
<br/>


By default cells with content following the pattern `hours:minutes:seconds` are of type *Time*, but there are a several ways of formatting times.

### Formatting text
By default cells with non numeric content are of type *Text*. It's possible to apply this type even to numbers, like for example phone numbers. 

Text entered in a cell spreads to adjacent cells to the right if these cells have no content. To confine text to a certain width in the cell, select the cell and click the button `Wrap Text` in the Alignment section on the Home tab of the ribbon. 


## Align cell contents
By default numbers are aligned to the right and text to the left, but it's possible to change the alignment of cell contents in the `Alignment tab` of the Format Cells dialog.

## Conditional formatting
Excel allows to apply a format to a cell depending according to some rules. To set a new rule click the `Conditional Formatting` button and select `New Rule`. There are different types of rules:

- **Format all cells based on their value** Applies a format style based on the value of the cell. There are 4 types of styles: 
  - *2-Color Scale* Applies a colour in a continuous scale ranging from one colour for the minimum value or percentage to other colour for the maximum value or percentage.
	
	**Example**. The next table shows the price of fruits during several months and the average price. The animation shows how to apply to prices a colour background in a continuous scale from green (the minimum price) to red (the maximum price).

	<div style="text-align:center">
	<img src="img/example_conditional_formatting_colour_scale.gif" width="800px" alt="example conditional formatting based on colour scale " />
	</div>
	<br/>


  - *3-Color Scale* The same than 2-Color Scale but with a third intermediate colour in the scale.

  - *Data bar* Plots an horizontal bar in each cell with a with proportional to the value of the cell. 

	**Example**. The next table shows the price of fruits during several months and the average price. The animation shows how to apply to prices a data bar format.

	<div style="text-align:center">
	<img src="img/example_conditional_formatting_data_bar.gif" width="800px" alt="example conditional formatting with data bars" />
	/div>
	<br/>



  - *Icon Sets* Divide the distribution of selected cell values in several parts according to intervals or percentiles, assign an different icon to each part, and plot the corresponding icon in each cell.   

	**Example**. The next table shows the price of fruits during several months and the average price. The animation shows how to apply to prices an icon set format. The icon set has three icons: red is applied to values under the 33 percentile, yellow is applied to values between 33 and 67 percentiles, and green is applied to values over 67 percentile.
