## Ordinary Differential Equations

Often in Physics, Chemistry, Biology, Geometry, etc they arise equations that relate a function with its derivative or successive derivatives.

> **Definition - Ordinary differential equation**. An *ordinary differential equation* (O.D.E.) is a equation that relates an independent variable $x$, a function $y(x)$ that depends on $x$, and the successive derivatives of $y$, $y',y'',\ldots,y^{(n)}$; it can be written as
\\[F(x, y, y', y'',\ldots, y^{(n)})=0.\\]
The *order* of a differential equation is the greatest order of the derivatives in the equation.

Thus, for instance, the equation $y'''+sen(x)y'=2x$ is a differential equation of order 3.

### Deducing a differential equation

To deduce a differential equation that explains a natural phenomenon is essential to understand what is a derivative and how to interpret it.

**Example**. Newton’s law of cooling states

> *“The rate of change of the temperature of a body in a surrounding medium is proportional to the difference between the temperature of the body $T$ and the temperature of the medium $T_a$.”*

The rate of change of change of the temperature is the derivative of temperature with respect to time $dT/dt$. Thus, Newton’s law of cooling can be explained by the differential equation \\[\frac{dT}{dt}=k(T-T_a),\\] where $k$ is a proportionality constant.

### Solution of an ordinary differential equation

> **Definition - Solution of an ordinary differential equation**. Given an ordinary differential equation $F(x,y,y',y'',\ldots,y^{(n})=0$, the function $y=f(x)$ is a *solution of the ordinary differential equation* if it satisfies the equation, that is, if
\\[F(x,f(x), f'(x), f''(x),\ldots, f^{(n}(x))=0.\\]
The graph of a solution of the ordinary differential equation is known as *integral curve*.

Solving an ordinary differential equations consists in finding all its solutions in a given domain. For that is required the integral calculus.

The same manner than the indefinite integral is a family of antiderivatives, that differ in a constant term, after integrating an ordinary differential equation we get a family of solutions that differ in a constant. Giving values to this constant we can get particular solutions.

### General solution of an ordinary differential equation

> **Definition - General solution of an ordinary differential equation**. Given an ordinary differential equation $F(x,y,y',y'',\ldots,y^{(n})=0$ of order $n$, the *general solution* of the differential equation is a family of functions
\\[y =f (x,C_1,\ldots,C_n),\\]
depending on $n$ constants, such that for any value of $C_1,\ldots,C_n$ we get a solution of the differential equation.

For every value of the constant we get *particular solution* of the differential equation. Thus, when a differential equation can be solved, it has infinite solutions.

Geometrically, the general solution of a differential equation correspond to a family of integral curves of the differential equation.

Often, it is common to impose conditions to the solutions of a differential equation to reduce the number of solutions. In many cases, these conditions allow to determine the values of the constants in the general solution to get a particular solution.

### First order differential equations

In this chapter we are going to study first order differential equations
\\[F(x,y,y')=0.\\]

The general solution of a first order differential equation is
\\[y = f (x,C),\\]
so to get a particular solution from the general one, it is enough to set the value of the constant $C$, and for that we only need to impose an initial condition.

> **Definition - Initial value problem**. The group consisting of a first order differential equation and an initial condition is known as *initial value problem*:
>
$$
\begin{cases}
F(x,y,y')=0, & \mbox{First order differential equation;} \\
y(x_0)=y_0, & \mbox{Initial condition.}
\end{cases}
$$

Solving an initial value problem consists in finding a solution of the first order differential equation that satisfies the initial condition.

**Example**. Recall the first order differential equation of the Newton’s law of cooling, \\[\frac{dT}{dt}=k(T-T_a),\\]
where $T$ is the temperature of the body and $T_a$ is the temperature of the surrounding medium.

It is easy to check that the general solution of this equation is
\\[T(t) = Ce^{kt}+T_a.\\]

If we impose the initial condition that the temperature of the body at the initial instant is $5$ ºC, that is, $T(0)=5$, we have
\\[T(0) = Ce^{k\cdot0}+T_a = C+T_a = 5,\\]
from where we get $C=5-T_a$, and this give us the particular solution
\\[T(t) = (5-T_a)e^{kt}+T_a.\\]

### Integral curve of an initial value problem

**Example**. If we assume in the previous example that the temperature of the surrounding medium is $T_a=0$ ºC and the cooling constant of the body is $k=1$, the general solution of the differential equation is
\\[T(t)=Ce^t,\\]
that is a family of integral curves. From all of them, only the one that passes through the point $(0,5)$ corresponds to the particular solution of the previous initial value problem.

### Existence and uniqueness of solutions

> **Theorem - Existence and uniqueness of solutions of a first order ODE**. Given an initial value problem
>
$$\begin{cases}
y'=F(x,y);\\
y(x_0)=y_0;
\end{cases}
$$
>
if $F(x,y(x))$ is a function continuous on an open interval around the point $(x_0,y_0)$, then a solution of the intial value problem exists. If, in addition, $\frac{\partial F}{\partial y}$ is continuous in an open interval around $(x_0,y_0)$, the solution is unique.

Although this theorem guarantees the existence and uniqueness of a solution of a first order differential equation, it does not provide a method to compute it. In fact, there is not a general method to solve first order differential equations, but we will see how to solve some types:

-   [Separable differential equations](#Separabledifferentialequations)

-   [Homogeneous differential equations](#Homogeneousdifferentialequations)

-   [Linear differential equations](#Lineardifferentialequations)

## <a name="Separabledifferentialequations"></a>Separable differential equations

> **Definition - Separable differential equation**. A *separable differential equation* is a first order differential equation that can be written as
\\[y'g(y)=f(x),\\]
or what is the same,
\\[g(y)dy=f(x)dx,\\]
so every variable is on one side of the equation (the variables are separated).

The general solution for a separable differential equation comes after integrating both sides of the equation
\\[\int g(y)\,dy = \int f(x)\,dx+C.\\]

**Example**. The differential equation of the Newton’s law of cooling
\\[\frac{dT}{dt}=k(T-T_a),\\]
is a separable differential equation since it can be written as
\\[\frac{1}{T-T_a}dT=k\,dt.\\]

Integrating both sides of the equation we have
\\[\int \frac{1}{T-T_a}\,dT=\int k\,dt\Leftrightarrow \log(T-T_a)=kt+C,\\]
and solving for $T$ we get the general solution of the equation
\\[T(t)=e^{kt+C}+T_a=e^Ce^{kt}+T_a=Ce^{kt}+T_a,\\] rewriting $C=e^C$ as an arbitrary constant.


## <a name="Homogeneousdifferentialequations"></a>Homogeneous differential equations

> **Definition - Homogeneous function**. A function $f(x,y)$ is *homogeneous* of degree $n$, if it is satisfied
\\[f(kx,ky)= k^nf(x,y),\\]
for any value $k\in \mathbb{R}$.

In particular, a homogeneous function of degree $0$ always satisfies
\\[f(kx,ky)=f(x,y).\\]

Setting $k=1/x$ we have
\\[f(x,y)=f\left(\frac{1}{x}x,\frac{1}{x}y\right)=f\left(1,\frac{y}{x}\right)=g\left(\frac{y}{x}\right).\\]
This way, a homogeneous function of degree $0$ always can be written as a function of $u=y/x$:
\\[f(x,y)=g\left(\frac{y}{x}\right)=g(u).\\]

> **Definition - Homogeneous differential equation** A *homogeneous differential equation* is a first order differential equation that can be written
\\[y'=f(x,y),\\] where $f(x,y)$ is a homogeneous function of degree $0$.

We can solve a homogeneous differential equation making the substitution
\\[u=\frac{y}{x}\Leftrightarrow y=ux,\\]
so the equation becomes
\\[u'x+u=f(u),\\]
that is a separable differential equation.

One solved the separable differential equation, the substitution must be undone.

**Example**. Let us consider the following differential equation
\\[4x-3y+y'(2y-3x)=0.\\]

Rewriting the equation this way
\\[y'=\frac{3y-4x}{2y-3x}\\]
we can check easily that is a homogeneous differential equation.

To solve this equation we have to do the substitution $y=ux$, and we get
\\[u'x+u=\frac{3ux-4x}{2ux-3x}=\frac{3u-4}{2u-3}\\]
that is a separable differential equation.

Separating the variables we have
\\[u'x=\frac{3u-4}{2u-3}-u=\frac{-2u^2+6u-4}{2u-3}\Leftrightarrow \frac{2u-3}{-2u^2+6u-4}\,du=\frac{1}{x}\,dx.\\]

Now, integrating both sides of the equation we have

$$
\renewcommand{\arraystretch}{2}
\begin{array}{c}
\displaystyle \int \frac{2u-3}{-2u^2+6u-4}\,du=\int \frac{1}{x}\,dx
\Leftrightarrow -\frac{1}{2}\log|u^2-3u+2|=\log|x|+C \Leftrightarrow\\
\Leftrightarrow \log|u^2-3u+2|=-2\log|x|-2C,
\end{array}
$$

then, applying the exponential function both sides and simplifying we get the general solution
\\[u^2-3u+2=e^{-2\log|x|-2C}=\frac{e^{-2C}}{e^{\log|x|^2}}=\frac{C}{x^2},\\]
rewriting the constant $C=e^{-2C}$.

Finally, undoing the initial substitution $u=y/x$, we arrive at the general solution of the homogeneous differential equation
\\[\left(\frac{y}{x}\right)^2-3\frac{y}{x}+2=\frac{C}{x^2}\Leftrightarrow y^2-3xy+2x^2=C.\\]

Linear differential equations
-----------------------------

### <a name="Lineardifferentialequations"></a>Linear differential equations

> **Definition - Linear differential equation** A *linear differential equation* is a first order differential equation that can be written
\\[y'+g(x)y = h(x).\\]

To solve a linear differential equation we try to write the left side of the equation as the derivative of a product. For that we write both sides by the function $f(x)$,
\\[f'(x)=g(x)f(x).\\]
Thus, we get

$$
\begin{array}{c}
y'f(x)+g(x)f(x)y=h(x)f(x)\\
\Updownarrow\\
y'f(x)+f'(x)y=h(x)f(x)\\
\Updownarrow\\
\dfrac{d}{dx}(yf(x))=h(x)f(x)
\end{array}
$$

Integrating both sides of the previous equation we get the solution
\\[yf(x)=\int h(x)f(x)\,dx+C.\\]
On the other hand, the unique function that satisfies $f'(x)=g(x)f(x)$ is
\\[f(x)=e^{\int g(x)\,dx},\\]
so, substituting this function in the previous solution we arrive at the solution of the linear differential equation
\\[ye^{\int g(x)\,dx}=\int h(x) e^{\int g(x)\,dx}\,dx+C,\\] or what is the same
\\[y=e^{-\int g(x)\,dx}\left(\int h(x)e^{\int g(x)\,dx}\,dx+C\right).
\\]

**Example**. If in the differential equation of the Newton’s law of cooling the temperature of the surrounding medium is a function of time $T_a(t)$, then the differential equation
\\[\frac{dT}{dt}=k(T-T_a(t)),\\]
is a linear differential equation since it can be written as
\\[T'-kT=-kT_a(t),\\]
where the independent term is $-kT_a(t)$ and de coefficient of $T$ is $-k$.

Substituting in the formula of the general solution of a linear differential equation we have
\\[y=e^{-\int -k\,dt}\left(\int -kT_a(t)e^{\int -k\,dt}\,dt+C\right)=
e^{kt}\left(-\int kT_a(t)e^{-kt}\,dt+C\right).\\]

In the particular case that $T_a(t)=t$, and the proportionality constant $k=1$, the general solution of the linear differential equation is
\\[y=e^{t}\left(-\int te^{-kt}\,dt+C\right)=e^t(e^{-t}(t+1)+C)=Ce^t+t+1.\\]
If, in addition, we know that the temperature of the body at time $t=0$ is $5$ ºC, that is, the initial condition $T(0)=5$, then we can compute the value of the constant $C$,
\\[y(0)=Ce^0+0+1=5 \Leftrightarrow C+1=5 \Leftrightarrow C=4,\\]
and we get the particular solution
\\[y(t)=4e^t+t+1.\\]
