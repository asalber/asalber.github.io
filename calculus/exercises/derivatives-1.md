## Exercise 1
Compute the derivative function of $f(x)=x^3-2x^2+1$ at the points $x=-1$, $x=0$ and $x=1$. Explain your result.
Find an equation of the tangent line to the graph of $f$ at each of the three given points.

<div><button class="solution">Show solution</button></div>
<div id="solution" style="display: none">
$f'(-1)=7$, $f'(0)=0$ y $f'(1)=-1$.<br>
Tangent line at $x=-1$: $y=-2+7(x+1)$.<br>
Tangent line at $x=0$: $y=1$.<br>
Tangent line at $x=1$: $y=-(x-1)$.
</div>

## Exercise 2
The pH measures the concentration of hydrogen ions H$^+$ in an aqueous solution. It is defined by
\\[
\mbox{pH} = -\log_{10}(\mbox{H}^+).
\\]
Compute the derivative of the pH as a function of the concentration of H$^+$. Study the growth of the pH function.

<div><button class="solution">Show solution</button></div>
<div id="solution" style="display: none">The pH decreases as the concentration of hydrogen ions H$^+$ increase.
</div>
