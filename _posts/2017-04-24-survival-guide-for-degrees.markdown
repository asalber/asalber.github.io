In this post I offer a collection of advices or tips that can help grade students, especilly during the first years, to be successful taking advantage of classes and learning to maximise its work.

I give this advices from a deep teaching background and from my own experience as a student.

Most of this tips could seem obvious but many students fail to put them into practice.


# Self Motivation

Motivation is the key for success in every project, not only in your academic education, but also in your professional life.
Without motivation it is likely to give up when you face the first learning difficulties or trouble, and there will be for sure.
Therefore, you should be borne in mind the reasons that made you start the way (especially when you have difficulties).
That is, try to walk with an eye in the goal and the other in the path.

A grade require a lot of effort, but you must think that many people, even with less capabilities than you, have finished it successfully.

# Be proactive

In primary or secondary school students usually follow the route traced by the teacher.
- But higher education is not compulsory and is the student who has to drive his/her learning.


## What does it mean to be proactive

- Explore the subject by yourself.
- Prepare classes in advance.
- Try to solve problems by yourself.
- Expand the information given by the teacher from other sources.
- Let your curiosity and creativity loose.



## The teacher is your ally

## The teacher is your ally

- The teacher is not your enemy nor a judge.
- The main purpose of the teacher is to help you in your learning process.
- Change your mind and think in your teacher as your ally.



## Take advantage of classes

## Take advantage of classes

- Attend to class just to sign the attendance list is counterproductive.
- In a master class save the key ideas and do not worry about the details.
- In a seminar try to prepare the class in advance.
- Ask your teacher to flip the class.


## What is a flipped classroom?

> The flipped classroom describes a reversal of traditional teaching where students gain first exposure to new material outside of class, usually via reading or lecture videos, and then class time is used to do the harder work of assimilating that knowledge through strategies such as problem-solving, discussion or debates.



## Do not be afraid to ask

## Do not be afraid to ask

- Try to overcome your shyness.
- No such a thing as a stupid question.
- Most of the times your doubts are the same as the rest of your classmates.
- The teacher need a feedback from the students.



## Take advantage of tutoring

## Take advantage of tutoring

- One of the main advantages of a private university like this is the availability and closeness of the teachers.
- Every student has a personal tutor.
- Every subject has tutoring hours.


## Use tutoring hours for ...

- Getting advise from the teacher about how to face the subject or study a topic.
- Reviewing concepts that you do not understand (especially if you missed a class).
- Getting help to solve difficult problems.
- Reviewing your test or exams.

## But ...

- Respect the tutoring schedule.
- Tutoring hours are not private classes.



## Read and write

## Read and write

- Try to complement the class notes with recommended readings.
- Write summaries and schemas with the key ideas of a class or a topic.

Note: Writing about a subject helps you to organize, clarify and fix the ideas in your mind.



## Work in groups

## Work in groups

- You will have to work in teams in your professional life and you have to get used to it.
- Working in groups have many advantages:
   - Helps you to develop social skills.
   - Reinforce the motivation being part of a team.
   - Enrich the learning with different points of view.
   - Helps to develop a critical reasoning.

Note: But working in group is not easy (especially when somebody does not assume his/her responsibility).



## Get organized
